Reasoning: The question requires synthesizing information from two annual reports across different years, understanding shifts in strategic priorities, and analyzing how NSW Health balances immediate crisis management with long-term innovation. It involves connecting multiple concepts (crisis response, structural reform, resource allocation, strategic evolution) and interpreting their interplay over time, which demands a broad contextual understanding and integration of several pieces of information.
