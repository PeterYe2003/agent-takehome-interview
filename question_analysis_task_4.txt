Reasoning: The question requires the respondent to infer an implied premise from Miller's argument, which is not directly stated in the text. This involves interpreting Miller's concept of "reading in the strong sense," understanding the context of the debate about reading "Heart of Darkness," and drawing a conclusion about the underlying assumption in his reasoning. Multiple pieces of information and a broad understanding of both the text and its critical context are necessary.
