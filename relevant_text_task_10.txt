Introduction 


The Problem of the Sociology of Knowledge 
The basic contentions of the argument of this book are imp­
licit in its title and sub-title, namely, that reality is socially 
constructed and that the sociology of knowledge must analyse 
the process in which this occurs. The key terms in these con­
tentions are 'reality' and 'knowledge', terms that are not only 
current in everyday speech, but that have behind them a long 
history of philosophical inquiry. We need not enter here into 
a discussion of the semantic intricacies of either the everyday 
or the philosophical usage of these terms. It will be enough, 
for our purposes, to define 'reality' as a quality appertaining to 
phenomena that we recognize as having a being independent 
of our own volition (we cann
ot 'wish them away'), and to 
define 'knowledge' as the certainty that phenomena are real 
and that they possess specific characteristics. It is in this 
(admittedly simplistic) sense that the terms have relevance 
both to the man in the street and to the philosopher. The man 
in the street inhabits a world that is 'real' to him, albeit in 
different degrees, and he 'knows', with diff
erent degrees of 
confidence, that this world po...

structed, this world acts back upon nature. In the dialectic 
between nature and the socially constructed world the human 
organism itself is transf
ormed. In this same dialectic man 
produces reality and thereby produces himself. 
Conclusion 


The Sociology of Knowledge 
and Sociological Theory 
In the foregoing we-have tried to present a general and syste­
matic account of the role of 
knowledge in society. It is obvious 
that our analyses are not exhaustive. But we hope that our 
attempt to develop a systematic theory for the sociology of 
knowledge will stimulate both critical discussion and empirical 
investigations. Of one thing we are confident. A redefinition of 
the problems and tasks of the sociology ofknowledge was long 
overdue. We hope that our analysis indicates the way along 
which further work might f
ruitf
ully proceed. 
However, our conception of the sociology of knowledge also 
contains some general implications f
or sociological theory and 
the sociological enterprise at large, and furnishes a different 
perspective on a number of 
specific areas of 
sociological interest. 
The analyses of objectivation, institutionalization and legiti­
mation are directly applicable to the problems of the sociology 
of language, the theory of social action and institutions, and 
the sociology of religion. Our understanding of the sociology 
of knowledge leads to the conclusion that the sociologies of 
language and religion cannot be considered peripheral speciali­
ties of little interest to sociological theory as such, but have 
essential contributions to make to it. This insight is not new. 
Durkheim and his school had it, but it was lost for a variety of 
theoretically irrelevant reasons. We hope we have made it 
clear that the sociology of knowledge presupposes a sociology 
oflanguage, and that a sociology of knowledge without a socio­
logy of religion is impossible (and vice versa). Furthermore, 
we believe that we have shown how the theoretical positions 
of Weber and Durkheim can be combined in a comprehensive 
theory of social action that does not lose the inner logic of 
either. Finally, we would contend that the linkage we have 
been led to make here between the sociology of knowledge and

say that secondary socialization is the acquisition of role­
specific knowledge, the roles being directly or indirectly 
rooted in the division of labour. There is some justification for 
such a narrow definition, but this is by no means the whole 
story. Secondary socialization requires the acquisition of role­
specific vocabularies, which means, f
or one thing, the inter­
nalization of 
semantic fields structuring routine interpretations 
and conduct within an institutional area. At the same time 
'tacit understandings', evaluations and affective colorations of 
these semantic fields are also acquired. The 'sub-worlds' 
internalized in secondary socialization are generally partial 
realities in contrast to the 'base-world' acquired in primary 
socialization. Yet they, too, are more or less cohesive realities, 
characterized by normative and affective as well as cognitive 
components. 
Furthermore, they, too, require at least the rudiments of a 
legitimating apparatus, of

symbols. For example, a differentiation may arise between 
foot soldiers and cavalry. The latter will have to have special 
training, which will probably involve more than learning the

Obviously ·a society will supply therapeutic mechanisms to 
take care of such 'abnormal' cases. We need not reiterate here 
what has been said about therapy, except to stress that the 
need for therapeutic mechanisms increases in proportion to 
the structurally given potentiality for unsuccessf

versions of the same common reality, the chances for success­

primary socialization. As the distribution of knowledge be­

a conquering aristocracy of one race ; the nurse mediates the 
world of a subjugated peasantry of another race. It is even pos­
sible that the two mediations employ completely different 
languages, which the child learns simultaneously but which 
the parents and the nurse find mutually unintelligible. In such 
a case, of course, the parental world will have dominance by 
predefinition. The child will be recognized by all concerned 
and by himself as belonging to his parents' group and not his

relationship to his own body (as to nature in general) is itself a 
specifically human one. The latter, on the contrary, projects speci­
fically human phenomena into non-human nature and then pro­
ceeds to theoretically dehumanize man by looking upon him as but 
the object of natural f
orces or laws of nature. 
45· For this possibility of a discipline of 'sociosomatics', cf. 
Georg Simmel, op. cit., pp. 483 ff. (the essay on the 'sociology of 
the senses'); Marcel Mauss, Sociologie et anthropologie (Paris : 
Presses Universitaires de France, 1950), pp. 365 ff. (the essay on 
the 'techniques of the body'); Edward T. Hall, The Silent Lan­
guage (Garden City, N.Y. : Doubleday, 1959). The sociological 
analysis of sexuality would probably provide the richest empirical 
material f
or such a discipline. 
46. This was understood very well in Freud's conception of 
socialization. It was greatly underestimated in the f
unctionalist 
adaptations of Freud, f
rom Malinowski on. 
47· Compare here Henri Bergson (especially his theory of duree), 
Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Alf
red Schutz and Jean Piaget.

Freud.

and, therewith, a n e w vocabulary for the art o f the n e w century. I t may t u r n 
out that illuminating connections can be drawn between Durkheim's trans-
gressing the boundaries between " p r i m i t i v e " and "civilized" i n the search for 
a vocabulary suited to comprehending, and then representing, the real, and 
Picasso's o w n encounters w i t h those same boundaries as he reconceived per-
spective. To give attention to Durkheim's rhetorical leaps is not to show 
where he fell short as a systematic thinker; i t is to amplify his voice and hear 
h i m better. I n Formes, one o f his tasks is to show h o w a kangaroo can be, at 
one and the same time, a powerful sacred being, a man or w o m a n , and just a 
kangaroo—all i n the real. His rhetorical tactics i n representing these barely 
representable things are i n themselves interesting to observe. That they have 
succeeded i n some way accounts for the book's capacity over the years to 
motivate fruitful empirical w o r k i n a range o f fields. 
ANATOMY OF A CLASSIC 
As a classic i n the sociology and anthropology o f religion, Formes is widely 
mentioned and characterized, i f not so widely read. M y purpose i n under-
taking a n e w translation is to re-present Durkheim's ideas about what he 
called the "religious nature o f m a n " i n the English o f our o w n day w h i l e ren-
dering Durkheim's French as faithfully as I can. I have undertaken this new

return to center stage i n our culture, after an unfortunate hiatus o f many

not only by sociologists and anthropologists or scholars o f religion. A m e r i -

damental and permanent aspect o f religion. I t thus followed that neither gods 
themselves nor beliefs about gods could be essential. W h a t i f we disagreed, 
insisting that observed believing was essential, contending something like this: 
I f gods and the supernatural cannot be observed by scientific means, action 
oriented to t h e m or presupposing belief i n t h e m can be. B u t i f only belief 
i n supernatural beings is the v i c t i m , then D u r k h e i m has a powerful reply: 
N o t h i n g durable is lost, for what is more fleeting or hard to observe than 
subjective belief? W h a t is more open to derailment, from one m o m e n t to the 
next, whimsically or i n the cold light o f observable fact (recall those very 
things whose "resistance" religions "could not have overcome")? A n d be-
sides, from the standpoint o f the social scientist, believers i n gods look ex-
actly the same as unbelievers i n gods—and exactly the same as people w i t h 
beliefs i n or about other things. T h e subjective is no handier than the super-
natural, and but slightly more accessible. I n those terms, we can begin to see 
the advantage i n Durkheim's choice o f observing religious ideas 
(représenta-

the subject o f B o o k Three) and, hence, w h y even his exposition o f the ideas

physics the direct descendant o f theology, had already implied that the idea 
o f force began i n religion, from w h i c h it was b o r r o w e d first by philosophy

Not being grounded in the real, magic did not survive, except as entertain-

makes: (1) religion is social, built on communities, whereas magical practices 
are individual, linking a practitioner and a client; (2) religion builds on altru-
ism, and magic on individual utility; and (3) given the previous two points,

are more than twenty words i n the Vedas to denote the sky. Being different, 
the words were believed to correspond to as many distinct personalities. B u t at 
the same time, these personalities were strongly felt to have an air o f kinship. 
To account for that kinship, they were imagined as f o r m i n g one family; ge-
nealogies, a marital status, and a history were invented for them. I n other cases, 
different things were designated by a single term. To explain h o w different 
things came to have the same name, it was allowed that the corresponding 
things were really transformations o f one another; and new 
fictions 
were 
forged to make these metamorphoses intelligible. O r again, a w o r d that had 
ceased to be understood was the origin o f fables intended to give it a mean-
ing. Thus the creative w o r k o f language continued, i n ever more complex 
constructions. A n d as mythology came to endow each god w i t h an ever more

were drawn litde by little into the circle o f divine beings, and thus were u l -

24This explanation, however, is no better than [Edward Burnett] Tylor's. According to Max Müller, 
man was unable to accept that life ended with death. For that reason, he concluded that there are two be-
ings in him, one of which survives the body. It is hard to see what could have made people believe that 
life continues, when the body is in full decomposition.

difficult to show in what way the terrible practices of initiation sustain the health that they place in jeop-
ardy; in what way the dietary prohibitions, which very commonly apply to perfecdy wholesome animals, 
are hygienic; in what way sacrifices, which took place during the building of a house, made the house 
more solid, and so forth. No doubt, there are religious precepts that turn out to have technical utility at

derstood. They do not constitute a ritual entity but are a composite made from various sorts of rites. For 
example, there are prohibitions, ascetic rites, and representative ceremonies that are indistinguishable from 
those conducted during the Intichiuma. Thus I have had to take this composite system apart and sepa-
rately treat each of the elementary rites that comprise it, classifying them with those similar rites with 
which they must be compared. In addition, we have seen (pp. 288—289) that initiation has served as the 
point of departure for a new religion that tends to move beyond totemism. But it was enough to show 
that totemism contained the seed of that religion; I did not have to pursue its development. Since the ob-
ject of this book is to study the elementary beliefs and practices, I must stop at the moment they give birth 
to more complex forms. 
41Spencer and Gillen, NativeTribes, p. 463. If the individual can, as he chooses, conduct a ceremony of 
either his father's or his mother's totem, that is because, for the reasons set forth above (p. 185), he belongs 
to both.

THE PRINCIPAL MODES OF RITUAL CONDUCT 
conveys positive virtues. This ambiguity shows that the real function o f a rite 
is not the specific, well-defined results i t seems intended to reap and by 
w h i c h it is usually characterized. Instead, its real function is a general result, 
w h i c h can take different forms i n different circumstances and yet remain al-
ways and everywhere the same. 
T h e theory I have put forward presupposes exacdy this. I f the true func-
t i o n o f the cult is to arouse i n the faithful a certain state o f soul, are o f moral 
strength and confidence, and i f the various effects imputed to the rites are 
only due to secondary and variable causes o f this fundamental state, then it is 
not surprising that the same rite should seem to produce multiple effects 
while keeping the same components and structure. I n every case, those m e n -
tal dispositions that its permanent function is to b r i n g about remain the same; 
they depend o n the fact that the group is assembled, not o n the particular 
reasons w h y the group is assembled. O n the other hand, however, they are 
interpreted differendy to fit the circumstances...

is the distinction between objectivation and reification.

As a classic i n the sociology and anthropology o f religion, Formes is widely 
mentioned and characterized, i f not so widely read. M y purpose i n under-
taking a n e w translation is to re-present Durkheim's ideas about what he 
called the "religious nature o f m a n " i n the English o f our o w n day w h i l e ren-
dering Durkheim's French as faithfully as I can. I have undertaken this new

translation at a time w h e n the serious study o f religion has finally begun to 
return to center stage i n our culture, after an unfortunate hiatus o f many 
decades. M y hope is that this b o o k w i l l be more widely read and studied, and 
not only by sociologists and anthropologists or scholars o f religion. A m e r i -
can postmodernist theorizers o f discursive practices and representations 
w i l l 
recognize through Formes the D u r k h e i m i a n pedigree o f M i c h e l Foucault.

Psychologists w i l l repeatedly glimpse o l d and not-so-old ways o f thinking 
about phenomena that the scientific study o f memory, identity, language, and 
intelligence must be able to account for. Philosophers w i l l find old problems 
interestingly tackled, i f not necessarily solved.

M y 
hope for a broadened readership raises a larger question, about 
Formes i n particular and the genus "classic" to w h i c h i t belongs: W h y read 
classics? O f late, that question and sundry answers to i t have framed a some-
times poisonous debate over w h i c h ancestors should be so honored i n m e m -
ory. This conversation is largely impersonal, as short o n "I's" as i t is l o n g o n 
impersonal, puritanical "shoulds"; i t is outspoken about discipline but inar-
ticulate about individual pleasure, and mute as the grave about excitement. 
Like broccoli, classics are said to be good for one, even i f swallowed u n w i l l -
ingly. M y v i e w is that dead ancestors should stay dead to us unless pleasure 
and excitement come from getting to k n o w them. W h i l e i n the midst o f this 
project, I heard W y n t o n Marsalis, the virtuoso classical and jazz trumpeter,

Religious Life in Seemingly Nonreligious Life 
D ü r k h e i m sums up what makes la vie religieuse inevitable: 
[I]n all its aspects and at every moment of its history, social life is only pos-
sible thanks to a vast symbolism. The physical emblems and figurative rep-
resentations with which I have been especially concerned in the present 
study are one form of it, but there are a good many others."

W i t h that s u m m i n g up, he suggests that we could apply the same analysis i n 
domains remote from anything w e could call "religious"—politics certainly, 
from w h i c h D ü r k h e i m draws some o f his o w n examples, and status orders o f 
various kinds (think o f the n o t i o n "blueblood," a racialized shorthand for the 
"set apart and forbidden" qualities o f West European aristocrats, and w h i t e 
bones for those o f Russia, as opposed to the black bones o f Russian serfs).

A l l such phenomena seem the more outlandish, and the more distinct 
from 
reason, the further they seem to be from our o w n experience o f the real. B u t 
the burden o f Durkheim's argument is that they are not to be separated f r o m 
human reason, i n full operation—hence, from us. Toward the end o f Chap-
ter 7, he uncovers the roots o f scientific abstraction i n the same processes o f 
abstraction that make collective identities possible. Therefore, i t is no more 
remarkable that a man should i n totemic observances manage to affirm his 
kinship w i t h a white cockatoo (despite physical dissimilarities) than that 
he should manage to affirm his kinship w i t h m e n and w o m e n o f the 
W h i t e Cockatoo clan (for, again, it is physical dissimilarities that must be 
overcome).. B o t h involve abstraction, by w h i c h invisible qualities are added to 
what is visible, for there is no other route to unifying the discrete i n d i v i d u -
alities that our sensory experience gives us. That the manner i n w h i c h this is 
done may be crude is beside the point: 
The great service that religions have rendered to thought is to have con-
structed a first representation of what the relations of kinship between things 
might be. Given the conditions in which it was tried, that enterprise could 
obviously lead only to makeshift results. But then, are the results of any such

Accordingly, the new title rejects Swain's rendering "the religious life." I f 
taken as an unfortunate artifact o f literal translation, the phrase "the religious 
life" furnishes D u r k h e i m w i t h a voice i n a heavily accented and game but 
clumsy use o f English. It is as i f he offered a Gallic shrug to an intellectually 
swamped A m e r i c a n undergraduate and said to h i m , "As we tell i n France, 
'c'est la vie'—that's the life'!" Well, Non. T h e definite article definitely does 
not belong there. B u t what about the English phrase "religious life," w h i c h 
suggests a life apart? F r o m the argument o f the preceding paragraph, i t is o b -
vious that the b o o k is not about monasteries or religious virtuosi, or about 
beliefs and practices sealed off w i t h i n a separate sphere o f human 
life 
uniquely their o w n . I n our o w n day, "religious life" connotes an exclusively 
inward and private sphere—but the seventeenth-century w o r l d that was hos-
tile to Pilgrims and Puritans d i d not, and the w o r l d o f Formes does not. 
T h i n k back to the way D u r k h e i m answered those w h o believe the function 
o f religion is to offer a theory o f the w o r l d : "Its true function is to make us 
act and to help us live." 
Finally, I t h i n k D u r k h e i m does mean "the elemental forms." H e offers 
his study based o n Australian ethnographies as a "single, well-conducted ex-
periment." It is very clear, from the first page, that although based u p o n o b -
servations i n A b o r i g i n a l Australian societies, he intends his findings to reveal 
the fundamental building blocks o f all religion, its ever-present source and 
natural resource i n the mentality, and i n the reality, o f humankind. Whatever 
is i n theirs is i n his and i n ours.

In this context, "empirical science" will do, but I retain the French phrase, so 
that the dense tangle of meanings can be unraveled by the reader according to 
context. The following statement by Auguste Comte can serve as a guide: 
"Considered first in its oldest and commonest sense, the word 'positive' des-
ignates the real as opposed to the chimerical. In this respect, it well suits the new 
philosophical spirit, the mark of which is its constant dedication to research 
that is accessible to our intelligence, to the permanent exclusion of the impen-
etrable mysteries with which it was occupied in its infancy." See André L a -
lande, Vocabulaire technique et critique de la philosophie, Paris, F. Alcan, 1926, p. 597.

P. 214. Dürkheim does not make the assumption that the rational capacity of 
man differs from race to race or from time to time. For him, humanity is one. 
For a statement of the opposite assumption, see Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, Les Fonc-
tions mentales dans les sociétés inférieures, Paris, Alcan, 1910, which Dürkheim 
disputes throughout Formes.

Cormack, "Rules of Sociological Method," has pointed out that this strategy 
is akin to that used by the ancient Greek rhetoricians, especially the sophists. 
82. 
He repeats this point in criticizing concepts like "primitive" and "savage," and 
elsewhere. See his side criticism of Frazer, for example, p. 183, and the dis-
tinction between origins and elements that he takes for granted throughout, 
for example, p. 55.

See Dürkheims rationale for simplifying in order to reduce differences and 
variations to a minimum (pp. 5-7). Note also that he opens the first chapter 
of Book One with the observation that even the simplest religions known are 
of very great complexity (p. 45). 
84. 
One sometimes hears the simplistic consideration that Dürkheim might have 
found exotic cases expedient at a time in France when religion was a hot but-
ton issue, and the anti-Semitism exposed in the Dreyfus Affair might have 
made it still hotter for Dürkheim. But then, what would we make of the fact 
that an international legion of scholars accorded totemism general theoretical 
interest? See Claude Lévi-Strauss, Totemism, Rodney Needham, trans., Bos-
ton, Beacon Press, 1963.

Peter Berger drew out some of these implications of Formes by devising the 
concept of "plausibility structures," communities whose everyday life takes 
for granted religious definitions of reality. See The Sacred Canopy, Garden City,

Psychologist Craig Barclay tells me that the scheme Dürkheim lays out is more

about how closely Dürkheim followed developments in psychology. Lukes's 
footnotes indicate that Dürkheim read Wilhelm Wundt through the 1880s and 
1890s, and it is clear in Formes that he closely read the work of William James,

only the mind but also the senses are not fully accounted for if conceived of 
in their individual aspects alone. Consider what the neurologist Oliver Sacks 
tells us about "Virgil," blind from early childhood, who through surgery 
forty-five years later regained the physical capacity to see. But, not having 
"spent a lifetime learning to see," he did not regain the seen world of his con-
temporaries—a condition for which neurologists have the interesting term 
"agnostic." See Oliver Sacks, An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales,

After defining sacre, Durkheim sometimes uses the term saint, without saying 
how the two are related. I speculate that the shifting has to do, at least in part, 
with the problem sacred objects posed for Durkheim's written representation. 
If "holy" is used to render saint, there is a risk of sliding over into religious ac-
tors' point of view, where religious objects are intrinsically holy. But at the 
same time, given in French was a fixed phrase incorporating the term saint: 
L'arche sainte specifically denotes the Holy Ark but is also equivalent to "sacred 
cow." The term saint is more frequent in Book III than elsewhere, four of 
whose five chapters are about ritual conduct regarding things that have already 
been sanctified (but are, from the actors' standpoint, intrinsically holy). As the 
context shifts, the same object comes into view as different at different mo-
ments, one during the process of sanctification, the other after the process of 
sanctification is complete. To be represented was not only changing time, and 
not only changing viewpoints, but also the changing fundamental nature of 
the object itself. I speculate that, for Durkheim, the two terms were some-
times synonymous and sometimes not.

put behind things, the personalities reacted u p o n the words themselves, 
thereby creating the riddles o f all kinds that the myths were invented to solve. 
Sometimes a single object received several names corresponding to the several 
aspects i n w h i c h it presented itself to experience. So i t came about that there 
are more than twenty words i n the Vedas to denote the sky. Being different, 
the words were believed to correspond to as many distinct personalities. B u t at 
the same time, these personalities were strongly felt to have an air o f kinship. 
To account for that kinship, they were imagined as f o r m i n g one family; ge-
nealogies, a marital status, and a history were invented for them. I n other cases, 
different things were designated by a single term. To explain h o w different 
things came to have the same name, it was allowed that the corresponding 
things were really transformations o f one another; and new 
fictions 
were 
forged to make these metamorphoses intelligible. O r again, a w o r d that had 
ceased to be understood was the origin o f fables intended to give it a mean-
ing. Thus the creative w o r k o f language continued, i n ever more complex 
constructions. A n d as mythology came to endow each god w i t h an ever more 
extensive and complete biography, the divine personalities, at first undistin-
guished from things, n o w separated from things and stood o n their o w n .

took the study o f this social organization i n order to determine its distin-
guishing features and, at the same time, to show its prevalence among the 
Indian tribes o f N o r t h and Central America. A t almost the same time, and 
moreover at Morgan's suggestion, Fison and H o w i t t
7 documented the exis-
tence o f the same social system i n Australia, as w e l l as its relations w i t h 
totemism. 
U n d e r the influence o f these leading ideas, studies could be done more 
methodically. Research encouraged by the Bureau o f American Ethnology 
contributed greatly to the progress o f these studies.
8 B y 1887, the documents 
were o f sufficient number and significance for Frazer to have judged it o p -
portune to collect and present t h e m to us i n a systematic overview. Such is 
the object o f his small b o o k tided Totemism,
9 i n w h i c h totemism is studied as 
b o t h religion and legal institution. B u t this study was purely descriptive, 
making no effort either to explain totemism
1 0or to delve into its fundamen-
tal ideas. 
Robertson Smith was the first to take up the task o f elaboration. H e re-

stitution o f such importance to bear a name that is given haphazardly, taken 
from

"mark," "representation," "significance," "coat of arms," "symbol," and "decoration"—indeed, to every-
thing except the animal or plant that serves as the totem of some group. I believe he intends to keep re-
minding the reader that while an animal or plant is the totem of some group, in itself it is not the totem; 
hence his careful locution, "the animal that serves as totem," which weighs down English sentences. Hav-

9 8 Every profanation implies a consecration, but one that is dreadful to 
whoever is consecrated and whoever comes near h i m . Indeed the results o f 
that consecration i n part sanction the p r o h i b i t i o n .

Notice that this explanation o f the prohibitions does not depend u p o n 
the varied symbols w i t h whose help the religious forces can be imagined. It 
is o f little consequence whether they are imagined as anonymous and i m -
personal energies or as personalities endowed w i t h consciousness and feeling. 
To be sure, they are thought i n the first case to react against profaning trans-
gressions mechanically and unconsciously, whereas i n the second they are 
thought to obey goadings o f passion aroused by the offense. Fundamentally, 
however, these t w o conceptions (which, by the way, have the same practical 
effects) do no more than express one and the same psychic mechanism i n t w o 
different languages. B o t h are based o n the antagonism between the sacred 
and the profane, plus the remarkable capacity o f the first to be passed o n to 
the second. T h e antagonism and the contagiousness act i n the same way, 
whether sacredness is i m p u t e d to blind forces or to consciousnesses. So au-
thentically religious life is far from beginning only where mythical personal-
ities exist, for w e see i n this case that the rite remains the same whether or 
not the religious beings are personified. This observation is one I w i l l have 
occasion to repeat i n each o f the chapters to come.

[Score: 6.0, Keywords: religion, sacrifice, language]: ...t gives the system o f rites just described its interest is that i t contains all 
the principal elements, and i n the most elementary f o r m n o w k n o w n , o f a 
great religious institution that was destined to become a foundation o f the 
positive cult i n the higher religions: the institution o f sacrifice. 
It is well k n o w n h o w m u c h the works o f Robertson Smith have revolu-
tionized the traditional theory o f sacrifice.
3 7 U n t i l Smith, sacrifice was seen 
only as a sort o f tribute or homage, either obligatory or freely given, and 
35Spencer and Gillen, Northern Tribes, p. 318. 
'"For this second part of the ceremony, as for the first, I have followed Spencer and Gillen. On this 
point, Strehlow's recent volume confirms the observations of his predecessors, at least in essentials. He 
recognizes, indeed, that after the 
first 
ceremony (on p. 13 he says two months after), the head of the clan 
ritually eats a bit of the totemic animal or plant, and that they then proceed to the lifting of the prohibi-
tions; he calls this operation die Freigabe des Totems zum allgemeinen Gebrauch (vol. Ill, p. 7). He even in-
forms us that this operation is important enough to be designated by a special word in the Arunta 
language. True, he adds that this ritual consumption is not the only one, that sometimes the chief and el-
ders also eat the sacred plant or animal before the initial ceremony, and that the celebrant in the rite does 
the same after the celebration. There is nothing implausible about this. Such acts of consumption are so 
many means used by the celebrants or the participants to confer on themselves the virtues they wish to 
acquire; it is not surprising that they should be multiple. None of that invalidates the account of Spencer 
and Gillen, for the rite they emphasize, not without reason, is the Freigabe des Totems. 
Strehlow disputes the claims of Spencer and Gillen on only two points. In the 
first 
place, he declares 
that the act of ritual consumption does not always take place. That fact is beyond question, because some 
totemic animals and plants are inedible. But the fact remains that the rite is very common; Strehlow him-
self cites numerous examples of it (pp. 13, 14, 19, 23, 33, 36, 50, 59, 67, 68, 71, 75, 80, 84, 89, 93). In 
the second place, we have seen that (according to Spencer and Gillen) if the chief of the clan did not par-
take of the totemic animal or plant, he would lose his powers. Strehlow assures us that native ...

THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY 
for sociological theory generally and for certain areas of 
empirical research. 
The logic of our argument makes a certain measure of 
repetitiveness inevitable. Thus some problems are viewed with­
in phenomenological brackets in Section One, taken up again 
in Section Two with these brackets removed and with an inter­
est in their empirical genesis, and then taken up once more in 
Section Three on the level of subjective consciousness. We 
have tried to make this book as readable as possible, but not in 
violation of its inner logic, and we hope that the reader will 
understand the reasons for those repetitions that could not be 
avoided. 
Ibn ul-' 
Arabi, the great Islamic mystic, exclaims in one of 
his poems- 'Deliver us, oh Allah, from the sea of names!' We 
have often repeated this exclamation in our own readings in 
sociological theory. We have, in consequence, decided to 
eliminate all names from our actual argument. The latter can 
now be read as one continuous presentation of our own posi­
tion, without the constant intrusion of such observations as 
'Durkheim says this', 'Weber says that', 'We agree here with 
Durkheim but not with Weber', 'We think that Durkheim has 
been misinterpreted on this point', and so forth. That our 
position has not sprung up ex nihilo is obvious on each page, 
but we want it to be judged on its own merits, not in terms of 
its exegetical or synthesizing aspects. We have, therefore, 
placed all references in the Notes, as well as (though always 
briefly) any arguments we have with the sources to which we 
are indebted. This has necessitated a sizeable apparatus of 
notes. This is not to pay obeisance to the rituals of Wissen­
schaftlichkeit, but rather to be faithful to the demands of 
historical gratitude. 
The project of which this book is the realization was first 
concocted in the summ
er of 1962, in the course of some 
leisurely conversations at the foot of and (occasionally) on top 
of the Alps of western Austria. The first plan for the book was 
drawn up early in 1963. At that time it was envisaged as an 
enterprise involving one other sociologist and two philo­
sophers. The other participants were obliged for various bio­
graphical reasons to withdraw from active involvement in the 
project, but we wish to acknowledge with great appreciation

problem of the social distribution of knowledge merely from the 
angle of the ideological foundation of truth in its dependence upon 
social and, especially, economic conditions, or from that of the 
social implications of education, or that of the social role of the 
man of knowledge. Not sociologists but economists and philo­
sophers have studied some of the many other theoretical aspects of 
the problem. 
23 
While we would not give the central place to the social 
distribution of knowledge that Schutz implies here, we agree 
with his criticism of 'the discipline thus misnamed' and have 
derived from him our basic notion of the manner in which the 
task of the sociology of knowledge must be redefined. In the 
following considerations we are heavily dependent on Schutz 
in the prolegomena concerning the foundations of knowledge 
in everyday life and gready indebted to his work in various 
important places of our main argument thereafter. 
Our anthropological presuppositions are strongly influenced 
by Marx, especially his early writings, and by the anthropologi­
cal implications drawn from human biology by Helmuth 
Plessner, Arnold Gehlen and others. Our view of the nature of 
social reality is gready indebted to Durkheim and his school in 
French sociology, though we have modified the Durkheimian 
thȿry of society by the introduction of a dialectical perspec-
INTRODUCTION 
tive derived from Marx and an emphasis on the constitution 
of social reality through subjective meanings derived from 
Weber.24 Our social-psychological presuppositions, especially 
important for the analysis of the internalization of social reality, 
are gready influenced by George Herbert Mead and some 
developments of his work by the so-called symbolic-inter­
actionist school of American sociology.25 We shall indicate in 
the footnotes how these various ingredients are used in our 
theoretical formation. We fully realize, of course, that in this 
use we are not and cannot be faithful to the original intentions 
of these several streams of social theory themselves. But, as 
we have already stated, our purpose here is not exegetical, nor 
even synthesis for the sake of synthesis. We are fully aware 
that, in various places, we do violence to certain thinkers by 
integrating their thought into a theoretical formation that 
some of them might have found quite alien. We would say in 
justification that historical gratitude is not in itself a scientific 
virtue. We may cite here ...

background of A's and B's activity remains fairly accessible to 
deliberate intervention by A and B. Although the routines, 
once established, carry within them a tendency to persist, the 
possibility of changing them or even abolishing them remains 
at hand in consciousness. A and B alone are responsible for 
having constructed this world. A and B remain capable of 
changing or abolishing it. What is more, since they themselves 
have shaped this world in the course of a shared biography 
which they can remember, the world thus shaped appears 
f
ully transparent to them. They understand the world that 
they themselves have made. All this changes in the process of 
transmission to the new generation. The objectivity of the 
institutional world 'thickens' and 'hardens', not only f
or the 
children, but (by a mirror effect) f
or the parents as well. The 
SOCIETY AS OBJECTIVE REALITY 
'There we go again' now becomes 'This is how these things 
are done'. A world so regarded attains a firmness in con­
sciousness ; it becomes real in an ever more massive way and it 
can no longer be changed so readily. For the children, 
especially in the early phase of their socialization into it, it 
becomes the world. For the parents, it loses its playful quality 
and becomes 'serious'. For the children, the parentally trans­
mitted world is not f
ully transparent. Since they had no part 
in shaping it, it conf
ronts them as a given reality that, like 
nature, is opaque in places at least. 
Only at this point does it become possible to speak of 
a social 
world at all, in the sense of a comprehensive and given reality 
conf
ronting the individual in a !Danner analogous to the reality 
of the natural world. Only in this way, as an objective world, 
can the social f
ormations be transmitted to a new generation. 
In the early phases of socialization the child is quite incapable 
of distinguishing between the objectivity of natural pheno­
mena and the objectivity of the social f
ormations.25 To take 
the most important item of socialization, language appears to 
the child as inherent in the nature of things, and he cannot 
grasp the notion of its conventionality. A thing is what it is

Such knowledge constitutes the motivating dynamics of

of conduct and designates all situations falling within them. It 
defines and constructs the roles to be played in the context of 
the institutions in question. I
pso facto, it controls and predicts 
all such conduct. Since this knowledge is socially objectivated

designated as moral depravity, mental disease, or just plain

In this way, the particular social world becomes the world

verses. A feudal society with a modern army, a landed 
artstocracy having to exist under conditions of industrial 
capitalism, a traditional religion forced to cope with the 
popularization of a scientific world view, the coexistence in 
one society of the theory of relativity and astrology - our 
contemporary experience is so full of examples of this sort 
that it is unnecessary to belabour the point. Suffice it to say 
that, under such conditions, the work of the several legiti­
mators becomes especially strenuous. 
A final question of 
great theoretical interest arising from the 
historical variability of institutionalization has to do with the 
manner in which the institutional order is objectified : To 
what extent is an institutional order, or any part of it, appre­
hended as a non-human f
acticity? This is the question of the 
reification of social reality.ss 
Reification is the apprehension of human phenomena as if 
they were things, that is, in non-human or possibly supra­
human terms. Another way of saying this is that reification is 
the apprehension of the products of human activity as zf they 
were something other than human products - such as facts of 
nature, results of cosmic laws, or manifestations of 
divine will.

the child recognizes that ever

SociETY AS SuBJECTIVE REALITY 
and the norm is generalized to, 'One does not spill soup' -
'one' being himself as part of a generality that includes, in 
principle, all of society in so far as it is significant to the child. 
This abstraction from the roles and attitudes of concrete 
significant others is called the generalized other.9 Its f
ormation 
within consciousness means that the individual now identifies 
not only with concrete others but with a generality of others, 
that is, with a society. Only by virtue of this generalized 
identification does his own self
-identification attain stability 
and continuity. He now has not only an identity vis-a-vis this or 
that significant other, but an identity in general, which is sub­
jectively apprehended as remaining the same no matter what 
others, significant or not, are encountered. This newly 
coherent identity incorporates within itself all the various 
internalized roles and attitudes - including, among many 
other things, the self
-identification as a non-spiller of soups. 
The formation within consciousness of the generalized 
other marks a decisive phase in socialization. It implies the 
internalization of society as such and of the objective reality 
established therein, and, at the same time, the subjective 
establishment of a coherent and continuous identity. Society, 
identity and reality are subjectively crystallized in the same 
process of internalization. This crystallization is concurrent 
with the internalization of language. Indeed, for reasons evi­
dent f
rom the f
oregoing observations on language, language 
constitutes both the most important content and the most 
important instrument of socialization. 
When the generalized other has been crystallized in con­
sciousness, a symmetrical relationship is established between 
objective and subjective reality. What is real 'outside' corre­
sponds to what is real 'within'. Objective reality can readily be 
'translated' into subjective reality, and vice versa. Language, 
of course, is the principal vehicle of this ongoing translating 
process in both directions. It should, however, be stressed 
that the symmetry between objective and subjective reality 
cannot be complete. The two realities correspond to each 
other, but they are not coextensive. There is always more 
objective reality 'available' than is actually internalized in any
