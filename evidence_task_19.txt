role of CCC mechanisms in regulating various diseases, which
have not only expanded our understanding of CCC but also paved
the way for innovative clinical treatments.
RESEARCH HISTORY AND MILESTONE EVENTS OF CCC
In multicellular organisms, cells have evolved different intercellular
communication modes to develop and regulate their coordinated
functions.29 At the macroscopic level, direct physical contacts
between adjacent cells lead to the formation of tissues and barrier
structures, while at the microscopic scale, they drive changes in
cellular signaling pathways and activation states.24 Comprehend-
ing how biological components synergize to orchestrate biochem-
ical, genetic, and biophysically mediated cell interaction events
among diverse cell types constitutes the essence of enhancing our
understanding of the biology underlying CCCs (Fig. 1).
Identifying cell surface receptors and their ligands, such as
growth factors, is crucial for understanding how cells perceive and
respond to external signals. During a research endeavor exploring
the speciﬁc growth-stimulating impacts of mouse sarcoma on the
sensory and sympathetic nervous systems of chick embryos, it was
unveiled that mouse sarcoma had the ability to generate a speciﬁc
factor to speciﬁcally promote the growth and development of
nerve cells.30 Later, this factor is well-known as nerve growth
factor (NGF) and stands as the inaugural growth factor to be
discovered, unveiling the pivotal role of extracellular factors in
modulating cell growth and differentiation. This revelation has
exerted a profound impact on the evolution of neuroscience and
cellular biology. With a deepening understanding of cellular
signaling molecules, researchers have begun to investigate how
signal transduction pathways alter in human diseases. Disrupting
and/or altering these cell interaction events can lead to severe
downstream
pathophysiological
effects.

in adverse drug reactions. Various hormones, growth factors, and

advance in treating autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases.
Nevertheless, while biologics have been therapeutically successful,
they may not completely eliminate rheumatic pathology in all
patients. Moreover, the efﬁcacy of numerous
such agents
diminishes gradually owing to their immunogenicity.369 By
modulating cell-to-cell signaling, it is feasible to suppress the
hyperactivation of the immune system and diminish inﬂammatory
reactions in autoimmune diseases. For example, introducing
molecules like “pseudochain” proteins on the surface of T cells
can disrupt signals between T cells and other cells, offering an
effective approach to treating autoimmune diseases. Many
cytokines hijack JAK and STATs for intracellular signaling in
autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases.370 Genetic mutations in
JAK and STAT genes are linked to a range of immune deﬁciency
syndromes and are connected to the development of auto-
immune diseases. Given their roles in downstream signaling of
cytokine receptors and growth factors, JAK/STAT pathways are
considered as promising therapeutic targets for both cancer and
autoimmune conditions.371 The efﬁcacy of small-molecule JAK
inhibitors in treating rheumatologic conditions illustrates the
potential of targeting intracellular signaling pathways for auto-
immune disease therapy.372
NK cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that
make a rapid respond to diverse insults through cytokine
secretion and cytolytic activity.373–376 They not only bring cell-
mediated cytotoxicity to bear on tumor cells or infected cells but
also regulate the effect of other immune cells via the secretion of
cytokines and chemokines, thereby playing a regulatory role in the
immune response.377–379. However, hyperactivation or malfunc-
tion of NK cells might be implicated in the etiology of speciﬁc
diseases.380,381 In viral-induced models of autoimmune diabetes,
NK cells are likely to contribute pathogenically in the later phases
of autoimmunity.382 The presence of a large number...

biological system homeostasis through redox reactions and drive
cellular regulatory pathways through subsequent signaling.522 But
accumulation of excessive ROS promotes cell proliferation by
triggering the pathological alteration of normal signaling pro-
cesses, leading to the malignant transformation from normal cells.
However, over-activated ROS levels could induce cell death by
inﬂicting damage on cellular structures.522 Consequently, ther-
apeutic approaches aimed at reducing excessive ROS to avert
early tumorigenesis or enhancing ROS to selectively kill cancer

in various signaling pathways. When external signals such as
neurotransmitters or hormones act on cells, the opening of
calcium channels or the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
reticulum can cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentra-
tion. Subsequently, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and then activates
downstream
enzymes
like
Ca/calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase II (CaMKII), affecting various processes within the cell.
During neurotransmission, the release of neurotransmitters causes
the opening of calcium channels on the postsynaptic membrane,
allowing Ca2+ to ﬂow into the cell, activating signaling pathways
related to learning and memory, such as the activation of CaMKII,
which promotes the strengthening of synapses.100–102
Switch proteins, like G proteins and Ras, regulate the opening
and closing of signaling pathways. Ras protein is a small GTPase
involved in regulating signaling pathways for cell proliferation and
differentiation. When growth factors such as epidermal growth
factor (EGF) bind to their receptor epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), EGFR activates Ras, causing Ras to switch from a
GDP-bound state to a GTP-bound activated state.103,104 The
activation of Ras promotes the activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) pathway, affecting the expression of cell cycle regulatory
proteins such as cyclin D, and facilitating the cell to enter a
proliferative state.
Enzyme cascades involve a series of enzymes that activate or
inhibit each other, amplifying and regulating signals (e.g., PKA,
MAPK). In the MAPK pathway, Raf (MAPKKK) activates MEK
(MAPKK), which in turn activates ERK (MAPK). Each step of
activation can lead to the phosphorylation of multiple down-
stream proteins. In response to cellular stress, the p38 MAPK
pathway is activated, leading to an increase in the expression of
inﬂammatory response proteins such as tumor necrosis factor α
(TNF-α),

tion. Subsequently, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and then activates
downstream
enzymes
like
Ca/calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase II (CaMKII), affecting various processes within the cell.
During neurotransmission, the release of neurotransmitters causes
the opening of calcium channels on the postsynaptic membrane,
allowing Ca2+ to ﬂow into the cell, activating signaling pathways
related to learning and memory, such as the activation of CaMKII,
which promotes the strengthening of synapses.100–102
Switch proteins, like G proteins and Ras, regulate the opening
and closing of signaling pathways. Ras protein is a small GTPase
involved in regulating signaling pathways for cell proliferation and
differentiation. When growth factors such as epidermal growth
factor (EGF) bind to their receptor epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), EGFR activates Ras, causing Ras to switch from a
GDP-bound state to a GTP-bound activated state.103,104 The
activation of Ras promotes the activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) pathway, affecting the expression of cell cycle regulatory
proteins such as cyclin D, and facilitating the cell to enter a
proliferative state.
Enzyme cascades involve a series of enzymes that activate or
inhibit each other, amplifying and regulating signals (e.g., PKA,
MAPK). In the MAPK pathway, Raf (MAPKKK) activates MEK
(MAPKK), which in turn activates ERK (MAPK). Each step of
activation can lead to the phosphorylation of multiple down-
stream proteins. In response to cellular stress, the p38 MAPK
pathway is activated, leading to an increase in the expression of
inﬂammatory response proteins such as tumor necrosis factor α
(TNF-α),

binding with neurotransmitter molecules on the extracellular side
of the protein. The portion of the protein embedded within the
cell membrane acts as an ion channel, creating a ﬂuid-ﬁlled
passage in the membrane for the transit of charged ions, but ions
are unable to pass across lipid or other solid membrane
constituents. This synaptic transmission modality allows for the
direct ﬂow of ions across the outer cell membrane rapidly. When a
neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the exchange of nucleo-
tide guanosine-5’-diphosphate (GDP) and guanosine triphosphate
(GTP) on the protein’s intracellular side is expedited, culminating
in the split of the G protein into α- and β/γ-subunits, both two
types of subunits can act upon “effector” proteins, altering cellular
biochemistry, physiology, and gene expression, initiating intracel-
lular chemical signaling events.84,89,90

Identifying cell surface receptors and their ligands, such as
growth factors, is crucial for understanding how cells perceive and
respond to external signals. During a research endeavor exploring
the speciﬁc growth-stimulating impacts of mouse sarcoma on the
sensory and sympathetic nervous systems of chick embryos, it was
unveiled that mouse sarcoma had the ability to generate a speciﬁc
factor to speciﬁcally promote the growth and development of
nerve cells.30 Later, this factor is well-known as nerve growth
factor (NGF) and stands as the inaugural growth factor to be
discovered, unveiling the pivotal role of extracellular factors in
modulating cell growth and differentiation. This revelation has
exerted a profound impact on the evolution of neuroscience and
cellular biology. With a deepening understanding of cellular

activated invasion and metastasis, metabolic dysregulation, and
evasion of immune destruction. Furthermore, factors secreted by
the primary tumor can modify the microenvironment of distant
organs, rendering them conducive to subsequently colonized by
metastatic cancer cells.207 The growth and progression of tumors

in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2 lead to the

PI3K–Akt signaling.215 The transcription factor Myc is a signiﬁcant
downstream target of the Ras-ERK signal as well as numerous

mechanisms such as receptor dephosphorylation, endocytosis,
and degradation, ensuring the precision and timeliness of signal
transmission. By activating a variety of downstream signaling
molecules and pathways, enzyme-linked receptors participate in
the widespread regulation of physiological functions, including
cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism, and
survival.
Enzyme-coupled receptors possess distinct molecular structures
and properties compared to GPCRs. For instance, tyrosine kinase
receptors possess protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. When a
hormone binds to the receptor, the PTK segment in the
membrane is activated. This activation initiates a series of
intracellular information transmission cascade reactions with
phosphorylation of peptide chains and tyrosine residues in the
membrane protein substrate.129 Ultimately, gene transcription
processes change within the nucleus and result in corresponding
biological effects within the cell. Most growth factors, insulin, and
some peptide hormones are transmitted through this receptor
type. It has been reported that PTK is pivotal in initiating
multicellular
responses
related
to
DNA
synthesis
and
cell
proliferation. The proteins encoded by many retrovirus oncogenes
and the intracellular regions of several growth factor transmem-
brane receptors exhibit PTK activity. The receptor PTK not only
plays a role in transmitting extracellular information, such as
hormones and growth factors, but is also involved in the
malignant transformation and proliferation of cells. PTK has been
identiﬁed and characterized as a selective, potent, and well-
tolerated kinase inhibitor suitable for cancer therapy.130 As PTK
takes a critical part in the development and progression of
tumors, it serves as a promising therapeutic target in cancer cells.

Several
difference-assembly-
based tools have been developed, including PyMINEr,697 iTALK,694
and CellTalker.698 PyMINEr and iTALK aimed to identify the
differential expression genes between cellular clusters and used
them as candidates for the ﬁnal LR pair interactions. PyMINEr
establishes gene co-expression networks ascertained through
Spearman correlation and integrates them with protein–protein
interaction networks.697 Unlike SingleCellSignalR, which depends
on genetic signatures for conducting cell-type identiﬁcation,690
PyMINEr’s characteristic gene signature is not provided. Instead, its
approach to delineating cell types hinges upon the enrichment of
subgroup-speciﬁc gene pathways. Actually, PyMINEr identiﬁes
altered signaling pathways based on differentially expressed pairs
of ligands and receptors. But iTALK categorizes LRPs into
cytokines, growth factors, immune checkpoints, and others,
focusing solely on communication between tumor cells and
normal
cells.694
In
contrast,
CellTalker
identiﬁes
unique
interactions between clusters by using differentially expressed
ligands and receptors within individual clusters.698 It assumes
cellular communication hinges on the uniform expression of
ligands and receptors among interacting cells. In short, CellTalker
and iTALK employ slightly different downstream analysis techni-
ques to assemble the deﬁnitive roster of pivotal interacting LRPs.
However, these methods may overlook common interactions
among all groups though they excel at identifying LRIs within the
dataset’s background.

It is noteworthy that since CCC serve as the downstream of all
data analyses,
setting thresholds
for LRIs can impact
the
interpretation and explanatory power of CCC results. A lower
threshold may lead to the identiﬁcation of more interactions,
including those with lower expression levels or frequencies, aiding
in the discovery of potential novel LRPs. However, this may also
introduce noise, including false-positive results.5,9 Conversely, a
higher threshold may reduce false positives but could also result
in missing some true LRIs. Therefore, when setting the threshold
for LRIs, a balance needs to be struck based on the speciﬁc
research objectives and characteristics of the data used to achieve
the most accurate and interpretable CCC results.
Spatial transcriptome-based tools
Typically, cellular interactions are conﬁned to restricted areas,
which is not captured by scRNA-seq.5 In order to minimize
incorrect exclusion in CCC analysis, integrating the cell’s medium
spatial position is essential.724 Spatial transcriptome technology
enables transcriptome proﬁling from cells in different locations on
tissue sections, facilitating the analysis of gene expression
characteristics at diverse spatial positions within tissues. mRNA
serves as the functional copy of active genes, and their localization
within living tissues is often related to the regulation of cell and
tissue growth and development. Previously, the analysis of
multiple mRNAs simultaneously required the crushing of cells,
making it impossible to understand the localization of mRNA
within cells. Fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) can
reveal environmentally speciﬁc transcripts while preserving the
tissue architecture necessary for RNA localization.725 This techni-
que is applicable to tissue sections and whole embryos, is not
overly limited by optical resolution, and can reduce noise signals

three regulatory mechanisms rely on the coordinated activities of
various functional cells in the body, necessitating a complex signal
communication process between different cells, namely cell signal
transduction. CCC is so crucial in the development of tissues,
organs, and immune responses that diseases can emerge when
cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information
(Fig. 3). Therefore, studying the mechanisms and regulation of cell
communication holds great scientiﬁc signiﬁcance for under-
standing the nature of biology and disease, and has practical
application value for clinical trials.
Some pathways may be abnormally activated or inhibited in
disease states, and drugs can act by targeting speciﬁc cell
signaling pathways.183,184 However, the use of drugs needs to be
strictly controlled to enhance the efﬁcacy of existing treatments
and reduce side effects. The United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) conducts rigorous reviews of medications,
and drugs approved by the FDA have passed a series of clinical
trials proving their efﬁcacy and safety in treating speciﬁc diseases
or conditions.185–188 Table 1 shows some FDA-approved drugs

different human diseases, including disease diagnosis, prevention,

The review comprehensively outlines the experimental and
computational CCC methods rooted in chemistry and biology to
decode the complexities of CCCs. It extensively examines how
biological functions rely on CCCs to regulate crucial physiological
process, including tissue homeostasis, cell development as well as
immune responses.5,24 Furthermore, this review sheds light on the
role of CCC mechanisms in regulating various diseases, which
have not only expanded our understanding of CCC but also paved
the way for innovative clinical treatments.

Examples of some diseases caused by representative abnormal CCC. CCC is an essential process that profoundly inﬂuences an
organism’s homeostasis, development, and disease processes. When cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information,
diseases typically manifest. a Tumor cells invade surrounding tissues and blood vessel walls, inﬁltrate into blood vessels and spread to other
parts of the body along the circulatory system, then interact with original tissue niche cells and migrate to distant tissues to colonize and
grow. b Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis: A pro-inﬂammatory environment initiates the production of ANCA

the growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, PDGFR) are activated,
leading to the accumulation of GTP-bound Ras (Ras-GTP).
Downstream Raf kinase is then activated by Ras-GTP on the
cell membrane, phosphorylating and activating MAPKK (MEK),
which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK (ERK).131
MAPK is able to phosphorylate downstream substrates, which
are often transcription factors (such as Elk1, Fos, Jun) or other
proteins that change cell behavior. The aberrant activation of
the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway has a bearing on many
diseases,
including
cancer
and
neurodegenerative
dis-
eases.132,133 Moreover, this pathway also interacts with other
signaling pathways such as PI3K–Akt, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), etc., jointly
regulating processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and
differentiation.
Another pathway activated by RTKs is the PI3K–Akt signaling
pathway. When ligands such as growth factors bind to RTKs, the
RTKs undergo autophosphorylation and activation, which prompts
the recruitment and activation of PI3K near the receptor. The
activated PI3K converts the membrane lipid PIP2 into phospha-
tidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3, acting as a second
messenger, activates Akt, thereby initiating a series of down-
stream reactions that affect cell survival, proliferation, growth, and
metabolism.134,135
GC receptors have a single transmembrane α-helix, with the
N-terminal ligand-binding site located on the extracellular side
and the C-terminal GC domain located on the intracellular side.
Once the receptor binds with a ligand, GC activity is activated.
Unlike the activation of AC, this process does not require the
involvement of G proteins. Once activated, GC catalyzes the
conversion of GTP to cGMP within the cytoplasm, which then bind
and activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). Similar to
PKA and PKC, PKG is a serine/threonine protein kinase that
mediates si...

Stem cells, a vital component of cell therapy, play a crucial role
in restoring organs and tissues, holding immense promise for
various applications. It should be noted that stem cells derived
from different sources exhibit varying capabilities in terms of
proliferation, migration, and differentiation. These differences
inﬂuence their suitability for deployment in anti-tumor therapy.
In detail, cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small fraction of
cancerous cells characterized by their capacity for multifaceted
differentiation, high self-renewal, and tumorigenicity.227 The CSC
theory postulates the existence of a minor yet crucial cadre of self-
perpetuating cancer cells critical in tumor metastasis, recurrence,
and resistance to treatment.227 Nevertheless, the precision and
biological role of CSCs are still ambiguous, prompting some
researchers to exercise caution and regard the theory as
contentious.228,229 Despite the ongoing debate, research on CSCs
continues to evolve and uncover new insights.230 CSCs were

Enzyme-linked
receptors,
commonly single-pass transmembrane proteins, have enzymatic
activity within their intracellular regions or directly interact with
proteins that have enzymatic activity. The activity of enzyme-
linked receptors is strictly regulated, including ligand-binding-
induced receptor dimerization, phosphorylation, and negative
feedback mechanisms. Ligands, such as growth factors, coupling
with the extracellular domain of the receptor, inducing receptor
dimerization or oligomerization, thereby activating its intracellular
enzymatic activity. Following receptor dimerization, the intracel-
lular enzymatic domains phosphorylate each other, activating the
receptor’s enzymatic activity.126–128 The activated receptor trans-
mits signals by phosphorylating downstream proteins (such as
protein kinases and transcription factors), triggering a series of
signal cascade reactions that ultimately lead to changes in the
expression of speciﬁc genes and regulation of cell behavior. The
termination of signal transduction is usually achieved through
mechanisms such as receptor dephosphorylation, endocytosis,
and degradation, ensuring the precision and timeliness of signal
transmission. By activating a variety of downstream signaling

MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF CCC
Cell signaling, which involves transmitting information between
cells or subcellular components, is an inherent characteristic of
living organisms. In diverse tissues and organs, cell signaling
facilitates communication and homeostasis, which are vital for
cellular interactions within their local environment. Signals can
propagate through various mechanisms, including chemical
alterations, mechanical forces, or their synergistic effects. A
multitude of extracellular signals and cellular membrane proteins
trigger selective intracellular pathways, inﬂuencing crucial cellular
outcomes such as survival, apoptosis, growth, motility, differentia-
tion, and speciﬁc functions like muscular contraction, synaptic
activity, or thrombocyte activation.72 Typical examples are the
triggering of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling
pathway in the context of tissue ﬁbrosis.73 and the excessive
activation of the Ras signaling pathway in numerous cancer
types.74 Over the last decades, extensive research into cell
signaling pathways has culminated in the creation of therapeutics
rooted in biological science, and the complexity revealed by drugs
currently in clinical use continues to uncover further insights into
the extent of interactions between signaling networks.75 Cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal
conduction, focusing on the generation and intercellular transmis-
sion of signals, and cell signal transduction, which emphasizes the
reception of signals and how signals are converted and processed
upon receipt (Fig. 2).

is not considered simply as a lipid storage disorder any more, as
research has reported the involvement of inﬂammatory mechan-
isms in the progression of the disease, such as the accumulation of
leukocytes at site of lesion.261,262 Leukocytes within the plaque
produce growth factors, inducing SMC proliferation in advanced
lesions.263 The ﬂow of atherosclerosis triggers NF-κB activation in
endothelial cells, leading to the production of inﬂammatory
cytokines, thereby establishing an environment conducive to
atherosclerosis.264 A typical atherosclerotic plaque contains a lipid
core, with apoptotic macrophages constituting a necrotic core.265
Macrophage activation triggers the release of various cytokines,
transformation into foam cells, and subsequent necrosis.266
In addition, coronary heart disease (CHD) accounts for 42.1% of

Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell
communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and
physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of
signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is
critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical
milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the
importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a
series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we
summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical
force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological
functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological
processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our
understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting i...

different CCCs to ensure biological development, homeostasis,
and tissue repair.
Essentially, CCC is a fundamental characteristic of multicellular
organisms.6 The dynamic communication network established
between cells through collaboration plays a pivotal role in various
biological
processes.6–8
This
interaction
is
integral
to
the
functioning of living organisms, inﬂuencing cellular metabolism,
energy transformation, maintenance of physiological functions,
regulation of growth, development, immune responses, single-cell
functions, and other critical life processes.9 For example, during
immune responses, CCCs enable immune cells to recognize and
combat pathogens. In growth and development, CCCs regulate
cell proliferation and differentiation, facilitating the normal
development of organs and tissues. Diseases typically manifest
when cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular
information.5
CCCs reﬂect the fundamental level of physiological commu-
nication, triggering responses to internal or external environments
essential for survival. When cells communicate with each other,
extracellular signals typically induce intracellular signal transduc-
tion cascades, leading to cellular responses such as changes in the
cytoskeleton, metabolism, or gene expression.10 The regulation
and feedback mechanisms at various levels of these transduction
cascades modulate the pathway’s activity over time.11 Signal
pathways are the basis of internal communication and response to
the external environment in organisms. They are responsible for
converting
extracellular
signals
into
intracellular
responses,
thereby regulating cell behavior and function. These pathways
involve a series of precise molecular events, including the

THE CLINICAL APPLICATION AND RESEARCH PROGRESS OF
CCC
As the body adapts to internal and external environmental
changes, various systems and organs of the body need to
coordinate to complete the adaptive response, including nervous,
humoral, and self-regulatory systems. At the micro-level, these
three regulatory mechanisms rely on the coordinated activities of
various functional cells in the body, necessitating a complex signal
communication process between different cells, namely cell signal
transduction. CCC is so crucial in the development of tissues,
organs, and immune responses that diseases can emerge when
cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information
(Fig. 3). Therefore, studying the mechanisms and regulation of cell
communication holds great scientiﬁc signiﬁcance for under-
standing the nature of biology and disease, and has practical
application value for clinical trials.
Some pathways may be abnormally activated or inhibited in
disease states, and drugs can act by targeting speciﬁc cell
signaling pathways.183,184 However, the use of drugs needs to be
strictly controlled to enhance the efﬁcacy of existing treatments
and reduce side effects. The United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) conducts rigorous reviews of medications,
and drugs approved by the FDA have passed a series of clinical
trials proving their efﬁcacy and safety in treating speciﬁc diseases
or conditions.185–188 Table 1 shows some FDA-approved drugs

crucial for the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of signal transmission. Cells
achieve precise signal localization and transmission by restricting
the distribution of receptors, enzymes, and other signaling
molecules to speciﬁc regions within the cell. In many types of
cells, speciﬁc receptors are localized to particular microdomains of
the cell membrane, such as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are cell
membrane regions rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, capable
of aggregating speciﬁc signaling proteins, including GPCRs and
RTKs.178,179 This localization enhances the interaction between
signaling molecules, improving the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of
signal transmission. Directed transport allows cells to regulate the
activity of signaling molecules within speciﬁc temporal and spatial
ranges. Certain signaling proteins are transported to the cell poles
during speciﬁc phases of cell division or concentrated in the
leading edge during cell migration, ensuring the correct execution
of cell functions. The transmission of signals within neurons
depends on the precise release and reception of neurotransmit-
ters, which occur in highly speciﬁc spatial locations. Neurotrans-
mitters are stored in synaptic vesicles at the axon terminals, and
upon signal arrival, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic
membrane, releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

The spatial distribution of signaling molecules also involves the

Different cell types and states may exhibit varying responses to
the same signaling molecule. Insulin activates the phosphoinosi-
tide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (also known as Protein Kinase B, PKB)
signaling pathway through the insulin receptor. Then, PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway can promote the surface expression of the
glucose transporter GLUT4 and increase cellular glucose uptake,
supporting energy production, and muscle contraction.106–108
Similarly, in liver cells, insulin also enables the activation of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and thus promotes the activation of
glycogen synthase, increasing glycogen synthesis, and lowering
blood glucose levels.109 In contrast, TNF-α can activate the nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
signaling pathway through its receptor and then promote the
expression of inﬂammatory response proteins, participating in
immune responses and cell repair processes.110 However, in some
cancer cells, the same signaling pathway may promote the
survival and proliferation of cancer cells because these cells may
have acquired resistance to apoptosis signals induced by TNF-α.111
Termination or reduction of signaling response:
To maintain the
cell’s sensitivity and adaptability to external stimuli, responses to
signaling molecules must be terminated or reduced. This can be
achieved through receptor desensitization, receptor downregula-
tion, degradation, hydrolysis of second messengers or switch
proteins, and negative feedback regulation, which involves
downstream effector molecules inhibiting upstream signaling
molecules, forming a closed loop. Prolonged exposure to high
concentrations of agonists (such as adrenaline) leads to desensi-
tization and downregulation of the corresponding GPCRs. The

the same signaling molecule. Insulin activates the phosphoinosi-
tide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (also known as Protein Kinase B, PKB)
signaling pathway through the insulin receptor. Then, PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway can promote the surface expression of the
glucose transporter GLUT4 and increase cellular glucose uptake,
supporting energy production, and muscle contraction.106–108
Similarly, in liver cells, insulin also enables the activation of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and thus promotes the activation of
glycogen synthase, increasing glycogen synthesis, and lowering
blood glucose levels.109 In contrast, TNF-α can activate the nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
signaling pathway through its receptor and then promote the
expression of inﬂammatory response proteins, participating in
immune responses and cell repair processes.110 However, in some
cancer cells, the same signaling pathway may promote the
survival and proliferation of cancer cells because these cells may
have acquired resistance to apoptosis signals induced by TNF-α.111
Termination or reduction of signaling response:
To maintain the
cell’s sensitivity and adaptability to external stimuli, responses to
signaling molecules must be terminated or reduced. This can be
achieved through receptor desensitization, receptor downregula-
tion, degradation, hydrolysis of second messengers or switch
proteins, and negative feedback regulation, which involves
downstream effector molecules inhibiting upstream signaling
molecules, forming a closed loop. Prolonged exposure to high
concentrations of agonists (such as adrenaline) leads to desensi-
tization and downregulation of the corresponding GPCRs. The
desensitization

milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the
importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a
series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we
summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical
force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological
functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological
processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our
understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting its application in discovering new
therapeutic targets and biomarkers related to precision medicine. This collective understanding provides a foundation for
developing new targeted drugs and personalized treatments.

INTRODUCTION
The coordination of cellular activities, essential for multicellular
existence, is contingent upon cell–cell interactions (CCIs) among a
variety of cell types and tissues throughout an organism.1–3
Cell–cell communication (CCC) is an essential process that
profoundly inﬂuences an organism’s homeostasis, development,
and disease processes.4 Typically, CCC involves interactions with
secreted ligands and plasma membrane receptors, yet it also
includes secretases, extracellular matrix proteins, transporters, and
direct cell-to-cell contact mechanisms.5 Different cells employ
different CCCs to ensure biolog...

experiments conducted in vitro involving one or two types of
cells and a limited set of genes. With advancements in science and
technology, data acquisition at the single-cell level enables the
detection of low-abundance genes and provides a robust
foundation for cell communication study. In recent years, multiple
research efforts have concentrated on intercellular signaling by
employing either the co-expression of all genes or particular cell
markers,25,26 the resemblance in expression patterns.27 or the
characteristics of regulatory networks.28 Understanding LRIs is an
effective approach to understand cellular communication at the
single-cell level, and a multitude of research endeavors are
dedicated to formulating strategies to construct cellular commu-
nication networks based on these interactions. Harnessing these
technologies, many laboratories have developed various algo-
rithms and softwares for cell communication research.
The review comprehensively outlines the experimental and
computational CCC methods rooted in chemistry and biology to
decode the complexities of CCCs. It extensively examines how
biological functions rely on CCCs to regulate crucial physiological
process, including tissue homeostasis, cell development as well as
immune responses.5,24 Furthermore, this review sheds light on the
role of CCC mechanisms in regulating various diseases, which
have not only expanded our understanding of CCC but also paved
the way for innovative clinical treatments.
RESEARCH HISTORY AND MILESTONE EVENTS OF CCC
In multicellular organisms, cells have evolved different intercellular
communication modes to develop and regulate their coordinated
functions.29 At the macroscopic level, direct physical contacts
between adjacent cells lead to the formation of tissues and barrier
structures, while at the microscopic scale, they drive changes in
cellular signaling pathways and activation states.24 Comprehend-

across cell membranes, enabling rapid signaling without the need
for speciﬁc receptors or transport mechanisms for their release
and action.
Transmission of signaling molecules:
Signaling molecules can
reach target cells via diffusion, blood circulation, direct contact, or
intercellular junctions. In the context of multicellular organisms,
four fundamental forms of intercellular signaling exist: autocrine
signaling, paracrine signaling, signaling through gap junctions,
and endocrine signaling. Autocrine signaling is prevalent in tumor
cells, wherein cells secrete ligands to induce responses via
homologous receptors expressed on the same cell. Paracrine
signaling
affects
nearby
cells
by
secreting
local
chemical
mediators into the extracellular ﬂuid, which act on adjacent target
cells through local diffusion. Signal transmission across gap
junctions involves molecules passing directly between cells.
Endocrine signaling occurs when endocrine cells secrete sub-
stances into the bloodstream, distributing them to various body
parts via circulation.
For long-distance signals, the bloodstream is the primary mode
of transmission. Endocrine cells regulate the production and
release of hormones by monitoring the concentration of speciﬁc
substances in the blood, such as glucose, electrolytes, and other
hormones. These hormones are then transported to various parts
of the body through the bloodstream, exerting regulatory effects
on distant target cells, thereby maintaining physiological equili-
brium and adapting to changes in the external environment.86 For
local signals, transmission through intercellular spaces or direct
cell contact is more common. Neurotransmitters primarily transmit
information through paracrine signaling. They are produced and
released by neurons at the presynaptic end, and transmitted
across the synaptic gap to the adjacent postsynaptic neuron or
effector cell. Once released, neurotransmitters diffuse across

pathway. These three pathways together constitute the main
framework of GPCRs signal transduction. Through different second

the production of cGMP. The cGMP binds and activates PKG,
which phosphorylates substrate proteins, activating downstream
signaling pathways to regulate cell growth and renewal.136 The
PKG signal transduction system regulates smooth muscle relaxa-
tion, nervous system function, and physiological processes such as
intestinal secretion, renin release, bone growth, and visual signal
transduction.137,138 Besides, there are signal transduction path-
ways directly initiated or propagated by intracellular functional
compartments. For instance, the receptor for NO is a type of GC
located within the cytoplasm, known as soluble GC. When NO acts
on soluble GC, it increases the concentration of cGMP and the
activity of PKG within the cytoplasm, leading to responses such as
the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.139,140 These pathways
are essential for coordinating the activities of each organelle with
other cellular components.
In addition to the signaling pathways mentioned above,
enzyme-linked receptors also mediate the JAK/STAT pathway
and the TGF-β-Smad pathway. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is
typically activated by cytokine receptors, which lacks intrinsic
tyrosine kinase activity, but interacts with members of the
intracellular tyrosine kinase family JAKs. When cytokines (such as
interferons and interleukins) bind t...

It is noteworthy that since CCC serve as the downstream of all

setting thresholds
for LRIs can impact
the
interpretation and explanatory power of CCC results. A lower
threshold may lead to the identiﬁcation of more interactions,
including those with lower expression levels or frequencies, aiding
in the discovery of potential novel LRPs. However, this may also
introduce noise, including false-positive results.5,9 Conversely, a
higher threshold may reduce false positives but could also result
in missing some true LRIs. Therefore, when setting the threshold
for LRIs, a balance needs to be struck based on the speciﬁc
research objectives and characteristics of the data used to achieve
the most accurate and interpretable CCC results.
Spatial transcriptome-based tools
Typically, cellular interactions are conﬁned to restricted areas,
which is not captured by scRNA-seq.5 In order to minimize
incorrect exclusion in CCC analysis, integrating the cell’s medium
spatial position is essential.724 Spatial transcriptome technology
enables transcriptome proﬁling from cells in different locations on
tissue sections, facilitating the analysis of gene expression
characteristics at diverse spatial positions within tissues. mRNA
serves as the functional copy of active genes, and their localization
within living tissues is often related to the regulation of cell and
tissue growth and development. Previously, the analysis of
multiple mRNAs simultaneously required the crushing of cells,
making it impossible to understand the localization of mRNA
within cells. Fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) can

THE CLINICAL APPLICATION AND RESEARCH PROGRESS OF
CCC
As the body adapts to internal and external environmental
changes, various systems and organs of the body need to
coordinate to complete the adaptive response, including nervous,
humoral, and self-regulatory systems. At the micro-level, these
three regulatory mechanisms rely on the coordinated activities of
various functional cells in the body, necessitating a complex signal
communication process between different cells, namely cell signal
transduction. CCC is so crucial in the development of tissues,
organs, and immune responses that diseases can emerge when
cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information
(Fig. 3). Therefore, studying the mechanisms and regulation of cell
communication holds great scientiﬁc signiﬁcance for under-
standing the nature of biology and disease, and has practical
application value for clinical trials.
Some pathways may be abnormally activated or inhibited in
disease states, and drugs can act by targeting speciﬁc cell
signaling pathways.183,184 However, the use of drugs needs to be
strictly controlled to enhance the efﬁcacy of existing treatments
and reduce side effects. The United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) conducts rigorous reviews of medications,
and drugs approved by the FDA have passed a series of clinical
trials proving their efﬁcacy and safety in treating speciﬁc diseases
or conditions.185–188 Table 1 shows some FDA-approved drugs

Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell
communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and
physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of
signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is
critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical
milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the
importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a
series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we
summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical
force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological
functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological
processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our
understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting i...

tion, thereby maintaining the normal operation of life. Molecular
transportation in cells is mainly facilitated by protein channels and
transporters. Regarding protein channels, their selectivity and
effects on molecules can be further understood through the study
of the structure and activity of proteins. As one kind of channel
proteins that can transport glucose and other monosaccharides,
SLC2A4 has been found to be signiﬁcantly downregulated in most
cancers and its high mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly related to
improved prognoses in patients with breast cancer.516
For transporters, the main purpose of most research is to study
their selectivity and activity. For instance, Glut1, the glucose
transporter found in the caterpillar in Namibian Canyon, has been
reported to increase due to gene expression or protein stabiliza-
tion.517,518 Because they can maintain the energy needs of various
biochemical procedures in tumor cells, it is important for us to
understand how glucose intake of speciﬁc cell types affects the
behavior of neighboring cells in the same microenvironment.519 In
addition to intracellular transportation, extracellular transportation
also plays a vital role. Extracellular transportation includes the
exchange of substances between the matrix and extracellular
ﬂuids, the formation of extracellular matrices such as collagen
ﬁbers, and their role in tissue structure and cell life activities. The
ECM is composed of a protein called collagen, which can support
and protect cells, and promote interaction between cells.520 At the
same time, the ECM can also regulate physiological processes such
as signal transmission and the release of mediated factors in
cellular activities.
Biological transport system technology leverages cell signaling
molecules to regulate the transport and release drugs or other
active substances. This approach can enhance the effectiveness
and bioavailability of drugs, offering signiﬁcant potential in

Cardiovascular diseases
Vital body functions such as heartbeat and blood pressure
maintenance are under the control of the autonomic nervous
system. The cardiovascular system respond to sympathetic
stimulation of hormones secreted from nerve terminals by
adrenergic receptors (ARs), which are the dominant GPCRs in
the heart. In vascular smooth muscle, catecholamine stimulation
causes vasoconstriction through α-ARs and causes vasodilation
through β2-ARs. In the heart, catecholamine stimulation causes
increased heart rate and myocardial contractility through β-AR.

myocytes

The contraction of the heart is initiated by an elevation in
cytosolic Ca2+ concentration within cardiac myocytes following
their electrical activation. This process is regulated by a multitude
of signaling pathways, which involve cascades of signaling
molecules culminating in posttranslational modiﬁcation (PTM,
e.g., phosphorylation) of target proteins.243 For example, CaMKII is
a pivotal regulator of excitation-contraction coupling and Ca2+
cycling, in charge of numerous essential cardiac functions.

accumulation of excessive ROS promotes cell proliferation by

However, over-activated ROS levels could induce cell death by

The coordination of cellular activities, essential for multicellular

Cell–cell communication (CCC) is an essential process that
profoundly inﬂuences an organism’s homeostasis, development,

nents of the MAPK pathway, such as ERK, forming a negative
feedback loop to set limits on signal strength and duration,
preventing overreaction.116 These mechanisms together ensure a
dynamic balance of signal transduction, allowing cells to make
adaptive adjustments to continuous or excessive stimuli, main-
taining the normal functioning of physiological functions.
Major signaling pathway
Within the signal transduction pathway, a receptor is a protein
within a cell responsible for receiving and transducing informa-
tion. Receptors in the cell membrane are termed membrane
receptors, while those in the cytoplasm and nucleus are known as
cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors, respectively. Ligands are active
substances capable of speciﬁcally binding to receptors. Receptors
speciﬁcally recognize and bind to signaling molecules, converting
them into intracellular signals to perform speciﬁc physiological
functions. Cell signals typically begin with primary messengers like
growth factors, hormones, and ions instigate a sequence of signal
transduction processes via membrane-bound or intracellular
receptors.

The conjunction of a ligand with its speciﬁc receptor triggers a
distinct cellular signaling route.118 There are two types of signal
transduction pathways based on the nature of the ligand and
receptor. One is the nuclear receptor-mediated signal transduc-
tion, wherein lipid-soluble ligands enter the cell through simple
diffusion and directly bind to cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors,
typically inﬂuencing gene expression. Another type involves
water-soluble ligands or physical signals, which initially act on

second messengers, switch proteins, enzyme cascades, etc.
Second messengers are small molecular compounds that carry
information within the cell. The second messengers play a crucial
role in cell signaling, capable of transforming the activation of a
cell surface receptor into the activation of multiple molecules
within
the
cell,
thereby
amplifying
and
conveying
signals
internally. This process activates or inhibits speciﬁc target proteins
and enzymes, triggering a cascade of downstream reactions.
Through these reactions, second messengers are instrumental in
regulating a myriad of cellular functions. The discovery of this
signal transduction pathway has laid the foundational framework
for understanding how cells communicate via chemical signals.
An early study elucidated for the ﬁrst time the role of cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a second messenger within
the cell, demonstrating its capacity to translate the cell surface
receptor’s response to hormones and neurotransmitters into
intracellular biochemical activities.96 When external signaling
molecules such as adrenaline bind to GPCRs, the associated G
proteins are activated. The α subunit of the G protein activates
adenylate cyclase (AC), converting ATP into cAMP. cAMP, serving
as a second messenger, activates protein kinase A (PKA). In cardiac
cells, the increase in cAMP leads to the activation of PKA, which
phosphorylates L-type calcium channels, increasing the inﬂux of
calcium ions, thereby enhancing the contractile force of the
heart.97–99
Calcium ions (Ca2+) are important second messengers involved
in various signaling pathways. When external signals such as
neurotransmitters or hormones act on cells, the opening of
calcium channels or the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
reticulum can cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentra-
tion. Subsequently, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and then activates
downstream
enzymes

different CCCs to ensure biological development, homeostasis,
and tissue repair.
Essentially, CCC is a fundamental characteristic of multicellular
organisms.6 The dynamic communication network established
between cells through collaboration plays a pivotal role in various
biological
processes.6–8
This
interaction
is
integral
to
the
functioning of living organisms, inﬂuencing cellular metabolism,
energy transformation, maintenance of physiological functions,
regulation of growth, development, immune responses, single-cell
functions, and other critical life processes.9 For example, during
immune responses, CCCs enable immune cells to recognize and
combat pathogens. In growth and development, CCCs regulate
cell proliferation and differentiation, facilitating the normal
development of organs and tissues. Diseases typically manifest
when cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular
information.5
CCCs reﬂect the fundamental level of physiological commu-
nication, triggering responses to internal or external environments

phosphorylation of peptide chains and tyrosine residues in the

The Ras-MAPK is an important signaling pathway mediated by
RTKs, mainly composed of three key kinases: Ras, Raf, and MAPK.
When cells are stimulated by growth factors such as EGF, PDGF,
the growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, PDGFR) are activated,
leading to the accumulation of GTP-bound Ras (Ras-GTP).
Downstream Raf kinase is then activated by Ras-GTP on the
cell membrane, phosphorylating and activating MAPKK (MEK),
which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK (ERK).131
MAPK is able to phosphorylate downstream substrates, which

From these migrating inﬂammatory cells, inﬂammatory mediators

damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD through the PINK1/
Parkin pathway.330 MicroRNAs that affect the occurrence and
development of AD are present in exosomes derived from both
peripheral blood and cerebrospinal ﬂuid in patients with AD.331
For example, exosomes affect the progression of AD by blocking
the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through miR-
185-5p or exosome content miR-193b.332,333 In contrast, exosomes
come from human cerebral spinal ﬂuid or N2a cells enhance the
synaptic plasticity destruction activity of synthesis and AD brain-
derived amyloid-β (Aβ) in vivo.334 In addition, exosomes from
astrocytes with accumulated cholesterol signiﬁcantly contribute to
the transport of APP/Aβ peptides and the inﬂuence of neuronal
viability in the affected AD brain regions.335
The excessive
phosphorylation
of
tau
protein
is also
a
characteristic of AD. Exosomes secreted by microglia are involved
in the transport of tau protein. Inhibiting the synthesis or secretion
of exosomes prevents the aggregation of tau protein in the
brain.336–338 Inhibition of exosome biosynthesis by blocking the
activity of a key enzyme regulating ceramide biosynthesis, neutral
sphingomyelinase 2, reduced the proliferation of Aβ plaque and
tau in AD mouse model.339 Some enzymes carried in exosomes,
such
as
neprilysin
and
insulin-degrading
enzymes,
reduce
intracellular and extracellular Aβ levels.340 In summary, exosomes
participate in the pathogenesis of AD by transmitting different
substances or information. Therefore, exosomes serve as transmis-
sion factors and diagnostic biomarkers for AD.341,342
In the exploration of AD diagnosis, some scientists believe that
exosomes in the blood of AD patients are fewer and smaller.343

The contents of these exosomes may have high potential value in
the diagnosis of AD.
In recent years, the roles of mast and microglia in the nervous
system have also been discovered. After responding to environ-
mental signals, mast cells secrete different neurotransmitters or
neurotrophic factors. This paracrine secretion leads to acute
activation and/or long-lasting changes in excitability and pheno-
type, which is associated with neuroinﬂammation.349 Besides,
exosomes derived from glial cells bind to toll-like receptor 2 and
the toll-like receptor 4 of neurons, leading to neuroinﬂammation
and even neuronal apoptosis. Exosomes derived from glial cells
transport abnormally expressed miRNAs, triggering and spreading
neuroinﬂammation.311,315 Understanding neuroinﬂammation also
requires recognizing that the non-neuronal cell–cell interactions
between glial cells, mast cells, and the glial cells themselves are
integral components of the inﬂammatory process. In this context,
mast cells play a crucial role in orchestrating the inﬂammatory
process, from its initiation to prolonged neuroinﬂammation.350

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR INFERRING CCC
Using single-cell omics data, various bioinformatics and computa-
tional methods have been developed to decipher biological
CCCs.676 (Table 2). Scientiﬁc research commonly adopts two
principal approaches: ligand–receptor (LR) signal-based algorithm
and physical location-oriented strategy.7 The availability of single-
cell data, particularly transcriptome data, has led to the develop-
ment of plenty of computational tools for deciphering CCC (Fig. 5).
These tools leverage diverse methods for predicting potential
intercellular communication events (CEs) based on prior knowl-
edge of CCCs.4 Various mediators facilitate the development of
tools for CCC analysis, including Ca2+,677 lipids,678 peptides,679
proteins,680 EVs,681 and electrical signals. These developed tools
for CCC analysis utilize different media, algorithms, and data types
to infer CCC, leading to the discovery of different types of CCCs
based on different principles and resulting in various visualizations
(Fig. 6).

for understanding how cells communicate via chemical signals.
An early study elucidated for the ﬁrst time the role of cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a second messenger within
the cell, demonstrating its capacity to translate the cell surface
receptor’s response to hormones and neurotransmitters into
intracellular biochemical activities.96 When external signaling
molecules such as adrenaline bind to GPCRs, the associated G
proteins are activated. The α subunit of the G protein activates
adenylate cyclase (AC), converting ATP into cAMP. cAMP, serving
as a second messenger, activates protein kinase A (PKA). In cardiac
cells, the increase in cAMP leads to the activation of PKA, which
phosphorylates L-type calcium channels, increasing the inﬂux of
calcium ions, thereby enhancing the contractile force of the
heart.97–99
Calcium ions (Ca2+) are important second messengers involved
in various signaling pathways. When external signals such as
neurotransmitters or hormones act on cells, the opening of
calcium channels or the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
reticulum can cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentra-
tion. Subsequently, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and then activates
downstream
enzymes
like
Ca/calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase II (CaMKII), affecting various processes within the cell.
During neurotransmission, the release of neurotransmitters causes
the opening of calcium channels on the postsynaptic membrane,
allowing Ca2+ to ﬂow into the cell, activating signaling pathways
related to learning and memory, such as the activation of CaMKII,
which promotes the strengthening of synapses.100–102
Switch proteins, like G proteins and Ras, regulate the opening

in the context of islet autoimmunity pathogenesis, the population of
insulin-speciﬁc Tregs is markedly diminished, and both the induction

pivotal function of Tregs in thwarting T1D aligns with the observed

pathways.496 Administering a low dose of IL-2 for ﬁve consecutive
days increased the number of pancreatic Tregs in NOD mice at the
prediabetes stage by 1.5 times. This intervention prevent the

by the TME, including dysregulated ECM, sustained activation of
proliferative signals, inhibition of suppressors and apoptosis,
activated invasion and metastasis, metabolic dysregulation, and
evasion of immune destruction. Furthermore, factors secreted by
the primary tumor can modify the microenvironment of distant
organs, rendering them conducive to subsequently colonized by
metastatic cancer cells.207 The growth and progression of tumors
depend on angiogenesis, with CAFs being a primary source of pro-
angiogenic factors such as VEGF or PDGF.208,209 Tumor cells
discharge pro-angiogenic factors into their surrounding environ-
ment, contributing to the secretion of PDGF by endothelial cells,
which attracts supporting cells to solidify the nascent blood
vessels.210 The PDGF released by tumor cells directly binds to

Different cell types and states may exhibit varying responses to

signaling pathway through the insulin receptor. Then, PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway can promote the surface expression of the
glucose transporter GLUT4 and increase cellular glucose uptake,
supporting energy production, and muscle contraction.106–108
Similarly, in liver cells, insulin also enables the activation of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and thus promotes the activation of
glycogen synthase, increasing glycogen synthesis, and lowering
blood glucose levels.109 In contrast, TNF-α can activate the nuclear

signaling pathway through its receptor and then promote the
expression of inﬂammatory response proteins, participating in
immune responses and cell repair processes.110 However, in some

Several strategies have been employed to construct cellular

developed computational approaches can be classiﬁed into four

CITE-seq provides detailed cellular phenotype features.
It is noteworthy that since CCC serve as the downstream of all
data analyses,
setting thresholds
for LRIs can impact
the
interpretation and explanatory power of CCC results. A lower
threshold may lead to the identiﬁcation of more interactions,
including those with lower expression levels or frequencies, aiding
in the discovery of potential novel LRPs. However, this may also
introduce noise, including false-positive results.5,9 Conversely, a
higher threshold may reduce false positives but could also result
in missing some true LRIs. Therefore, when setting the threshold
for LRIs, a balance needs to be struck based on the speciﬁc
research objectives and characteristics of the data used to achieve
the most accurate and interpretable CCC results.
Spatial transcriptome-based tools
Typically, cellular interactions are conﬁned to restricted areas,
which is not captured by scRNA-seq.5 In order to minimize
incorrect exclusion in CCC analysis, integrating the cell’s medium
spatial position is essential.724 Spatial transcriptome technology
enables transcriptome proﬁling from cells in different locations on
tissue sections, facilitating the analysis of gene expression
characteristics at diverse spatial positions within tissues. mRNA
serves as the functional copy of active genes, and their localization
within living tissues is often related to the regulation of cell and
tissue growth and development. Previously, the analysis of
multiple mRNAs simultaneously required the crushing of cells,
making it impossible to understand the localization of mRNA
within cells. Fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) can
reveal environmentally speciﬁc transcripts while preserving the
tissue architecture necessary for RNA localization.725 This techni-
que is applicable to tissue sections and whole embryos, is not
overly limited by optical resolution, and can reduce noise signals

Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell
communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and
physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of
signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is
critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical
milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the
importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a
series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we
summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical
force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological
functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological
processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our
understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting i...

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR INFERRING CCC
Using single-cell omics data, various bioinformatics and computa-
tional methods have been developed to decipher biological
CCCs.676 (Table 2). Scientiﬁc research commonly adopts two
principal approaches: ligand–receptor (LR) signal-based algorithm
and physical location-oriented strategy.7 The availability of single-

These tools leverage diverse methods for predicting potential
intercellular communication events (CEs) based on prior knowl-
edge of CCCs.4 Various mediators facilitate the development of
tools for CCC analysis, including Ca2+,677 lipids,678 peptides,679
proteins,680 EVs,681 and electrical signals. These developed tools
for CCC analysis utilize different media, algorithms, and data types
to infer CCC, leading to the discovery of different types of CCCs
based on different principles and resulting in various visualizations
(Fig. 6).

milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the
importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a
series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we
summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical
force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological
functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological
processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our
understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting its application in discovering new

INTRODUCTION
The coordination of cellular activities, essential for multicellular
existence, is contingent upon cell–cell interactions (CCIs) among a
variety of cell types and tissues throughout an organism.1–3
Cell–cell communication (CCC) is an essential process that
profoundly inﬂuences an organism’s homeostasis, development,
and disease processes.4 Typically, CCC involves interactions with
secreted ligands and plasma membrane receptors, yet it also
includes secretases, extracellular matrix proteins, transporters, and
direct cell-to-cell contact mechanisms.5 Different cells employ
different CCCs to ensure biolog...

This process is vital for the proper relaxation of muscles and the
prevention of continuous contraction (spasm). These mechanisms
work
together
to ensure
the
dynamic
regulation
of signal
transmission and the cell’s adaptability to environmental changes.
THE CLINICAL APPLICATION AND RESEARCH PROGRESS OF
CCC
As the body adapts to internal and external environmental
changes, various systems and organs of the body need to
coordinate to complete the adaptive response, including nervous,
humoral, and self-regulatory systems. At the micro-level, these
three regulatory mechanisms rely on the coordinated activities of
various functional cells in the body, necessitating a complex signal
communication process between different cells, namely cell signal
transduction. CCC is so crucial in the development of tissues,
organs, and immune responses that diseases can emerge when
cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information
(Fig. 3). Therefore, studying the mechanisms and regulation of cell
communication holds great scientiﬁc signiﬁcance for under-
standing the nature of biology and disease, and has practical
application value for clinical trials.
Some pathways may be abnormally activated or inhibited in
disease states, and drugs can act by targeting speciﬁc cell
signaling pathways.183,184 However, the use of drugs needs to be
strictly controlled to enhance the efﬁcacy of existing treatments
and reduce side effects. The United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) conducts rigorous reviews of medications,
and drugs approved by the FDA have passed a series of clinical
trials proving their efﬁcacy and safety in treating speciﬁc diseases
or conditions.185–188 Table 1 shows some FDA-approved drugs
taking effects through therapeutic CCC targets. In the following
sections of this chapter, we will introduce the role of CCC in
different human diseases, including diseas...

software facilitates the semi-quantitative analysis of diverse

Single-cell multiomic tools
The continuous advancement of single-cell omics technology has
equipped us with a potent tool to explore cell interaction and
communication. Techniques including single-cell transcriptomics
and proteomics, offer detailed observations of gene expression
and protein synthesis in single cells, respectively. These technol-
ogies have broad applications in biological and medical research,
offering fresh insights and possibilities for deepening our under-
standing of cell interaction and communication.
Single-cell sequencing is an advanced biotechnology that
facilitates detailed decoding of gene expression and genetic
alteration for each cell in a tissue sample. For example, single-
cell DNA sequencing permits accurate DNA mapping for each
unique cell. Going beyond this, the more intricate single-cell
multi-omics sequencing, this is to say single-cell multimodal
omics analysis, facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of various
dimensions of omics data from an individual cell. Practically,

impaired, affecting the biological effects of insulin. The studies of
the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance enhance our

NF-κB signaling pathway, the ubiquitination and subsequent
proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα are critical steps for
activating NF-κB.180
Furthermore, the synthesis of signaling molecules such as
neurotransmitters is essential for the transmission of neural signals.
For instance, serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan catalyzed by
tryptophan hydroxylase. The amount of serotonin synthesized
directly affects the strength of neural signal transmission and
psychological states, such as mood and sleep.181 The timely
degradation of signaling molecules is also crucial to ensure the
temporariness of the signal and the restoration of the resting state.
For example, acetylcholine is rapidly degraded by acetylcholinester-
ase, ending its signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction.182
This process is vital for the proper relaxation of muscles and the

crucial for the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of signal transmission. Cells
achieve precise signal localization and transmission by restricting
the distribution of receptors, enzymes, and other signaling
molecules to speciﬁc regions within the cell. In many types of
cells, speciﬁc receptors are localized to particular microdomains of
the cell membrane, such as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are cell
membrane regions rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, capable
of aggregating speciﬁc signaling proteins, including GPCRs and
RTKs.178,179 This localization enhances the interaction between
signaling molecules, improving the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of
signal transmission. Directed transport allows cells to regulate the
activity of signaling molecules within speciﬁc temporal and spatial
ranges. Certain signaling proteins are transported to the cell poles
during speciﬁc phases of cell division or concentrated in the
leading edge during cell migration, ensuring the correct execution
of cell functions. The transmission of signals within neurons
depends on the precise release and reception of neurotransmit-
ters, which occur in highly speciﬁc spatial locations. Neurotrans-
mitters are stored in synaptic vesicles at the axon terminals, and
upon signal arrival, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic
membrane, releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

Receptors typically located on the postsynaptic membrane ensure

The spatial distribution of signaling molecules also involves the

receptors, such as estrogen and androgen receptors, are usually

binding, the receptor–hormone complex moves into the nucleus,

three regulatory mechanisms rely on the coordinated activities of
various functional cells in the body, necessitating a complex signal
communication process between different cells, namely cell signal
transduction. CCC is so crucial in the development of tissues,
organs, and immune responses that diseases can emerge when
cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information
(Fig. 3). Therefore, studying the mechanisms and regulation of cell
communication holds great scientiﬁc signiﬁcance for under-
standing the nature of biology and disease, and has practical
application value for clinical trials.
Some pathways may be abnormally activated or inhibited in
disease states, and drugs can act by targeting speciﬁc cell
signaling pathways.183,184 However, the use of drugs needs to be
strictly controlled to enhance the efﬁcacy of existing treatments
and reduce side effects. The United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) conducts rigorous reviews of medications,
and drugs approved by the FDA have passed a series of clinical
trials proving their efﬁcacy and safety in treating speciﬁc diseases
or conditions.185–188 Table 1 shows some FDA-approved drugs
taking effects through therapeutic CCC targets. In the following
sections of this chapter, we will introduce the role of CCC in
different human diseases, including disease diagnosis, prevention,
treatment, and prediction.
Cancers
Cancer is widely recognized as a cluster of disorders marked by
uncontrolled proliferation and dissemination of aberrant cells.189
Cancer remains a major global challenge even though signiﬁcant
efforts have been made to develop new cancer treatments. As a
result, the discovery of novel therapeutics speciﬁcally targeting
diverse cancer forms is imperative.190 Since various signal
transduction pathways regulate cell growth, abnormal activation
or suppression of these pathways drives tumorigenesis.121 One of

The rise and fall of cAMP levels are crucial for signal
transmission. The degradation of cAMP is catalyzed by cAMP
phosphodiesterase,
which
converts
cAMP

AMP,
thereby
terminating the signal transmission mediated by cAMP.114,115
The

signaling
pathway
acts
importantly
in
cell
proliferation and differentiation. Activation of this pathway
promotes the phosphorylation of a sequence of downstream
effector
molecules,
consisting
of
transcription
factors,
thus
affecting gene expression. Meanwhile, the MAPK pathway also
activates certain phosphatases, such as DUSP (dual-speciﬁcity
phosphatases), which can dephosphorylate and inhibit compo-
nents of the MAPK pathway, such as ERK, forming a negative
feedback loop to set limits on signal strength and duration,
preventing overreaction.116 These mechanisms together ensure a
dynamic balance of signal transduction, allowing cells to make
adaptive adjustments to continuous or excessive stimuli, main-
taining the normal functioning of physiological functions.
Major signaling pathway
Within the signal transduction pathway, a receptor is a protein
within a cell responsible for receiving and transducing informa-
tion. Receptors in the cell membrane are termed membrane
receptors, while those in the cytoplasm and nucleus are known as
cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors, respectively. Ligands are active
substances capable of speciﬁcally binding to receptors. Receptors
speciﬁcally recognize and bind to signaling molecules, converting
them into intracellular signals to perform speciﬁc physiological
functions. Cell signals typically begin with primary messengers like
growth factors, hormones, and ions instigate a sequence of signal
transduction processes via membrane-bound or intracellular
receptors.

different CCCs to ensure biological development, homeostasis,
and tissue repair.
Essentially, CCC is a fundamental characteristic of multicellular
organisms.6 The dynamic communication network established
between cells through collaboration plays a pivotal role in various
biological
processes.6–8
This
interaction
is
integral
to
the
functioning of living organisms, inﬂuencing cellular metabolism,
energy transformation, maintenance of physiological functions,
regulation of growth, development, immune responses, single-cell
functions, and other critical life processes.9 For example, during
immune responses, CCCs enable immune cells to recognize and
combat pathogens. In growth and development, CCCs regulate
cell proliferation and differentiation, facilitating the normal
development of organs and tissues. Diseases typically manifest
when cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular
information.5
CCCs reﬂect the fundamental level of physiological commu-
nication, triggering responses to internal or external environments
essential for survival. When cells communicate with each other,
extracellular signals typically induce intracellular signal transduc-
tion cascades, leading to cellular responses such as changes in the
cytoskeleton, metabolism, or gene expression.10 The regulation
and feedback mechanisms at various levels of these transduction
cascades modulate the pathway’s activity over time.11 Signal
pathways are the basis of internal communication and response to
the external environment in organisms. They are responsible for
converting
extracellular
signals

intracellular
responses,
thereby regulating cell behavior and function. These pathways
involve a series of precise molecular events, including the

Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell
communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and
physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of
signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is
critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical
milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed ...

labeling with single-molecule binding analysis, previously undi-
sclosed direct connections have been unveiled between the
extracellular domains of numerous transmembrane proteins and
E-cadherin (an essential cell–cell adhesion protein).613 As the
labeling efﬁciency with BirA* was found to be slow (taking
18–24 h), a more rapid system called TurboID was created, capable
of completing labeling in a mere 10 min.614 The TurboID
technique has been employed to identify proteins at epithelial
cell junctions by fusing the enzyme with the extracellular domain
of E-cadherin.613
Mechanical force analysis
Although the shape of organisms is encoded in their genomes,
the information coded by DNA is not enough to rule the ultimate
architecture of tissues and organs, nor can the cell expression
proﬁles tell us how complex functions are achieved. The
developmental trajectories culminating in the deﬁnitive morphol-
ogy of vertebrates involve continuous feedback between dynamic
mechanical forces along with cell growth and movement.
Mechanical forces are ruled by cells and integrated into tissues
through mechanotransduction processes that affect cell shape,
proliferation, migration, and programmed cell death, collectively
sculpting the ﬁnal form of organism.615 The core of these
processes is primarily the myosin motors, and the quasi-stable
state of cell tension is maintained by these myosin contraction
force mechanosensors, allowing cells to deﬁne the shape and
tension of organs.615 The initial discovery that cancer cells can
grow in soft agar in an anchorage-independent manner,616,617
while most noncancer cells cannot, sparked interest in the role of
mechanotransduction at the cellular level. Red blood cells
exposed to anionic and cationic drugs undergo different changes
in intracellular and extracellular surface membrane tension,
resulting in modiﬁcations to cell morphology.618 This observation

Gene-targeting medications available commercially can effectively

There are many other types of enzyme-linked receptors, among
which the more important ones include receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) and guanylate cyclase (GC) receptors. RTKs refer to
receptors
whose
intracellular
part
of
the
membrane
itself
possesses tyrosine kinase activity. The extracellular signaling
molecules that can bind to these receptors and complete signal
transduction are mainly various growth factors, such as epidermal
growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, ﬁbroblast growth
factor, and insulin. When the extracellular part of the receptor
binds to a ligand, the activation of the tyrosine kinase in the
cytoplasmic part of the receptor molecule occurs, thereby
triggering various signaling proteins to transmit signals along
different pathways reviewed below.
The Ras-MAPK is an important signaling pathway mediated by
RTKs, mainly composed of three key kinases: Ras, Raf, and MAPK.
When cells are stimulated by growth factors such as EGF, PDGF,
the growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, PDGFR) are activated,
leading to the accumulation of GTP-bound Ras (Ras-GTP).
Downstream Raf kinase is then activated by Ras-GTP on the
cell membrane, phosphorylating and activating MAPKK (MEK),
which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK (ERK).131
MAPK is able to phosphorylate downstream substrates, which
are often transcription factors (such as Elk1, Fos, Jun) or other
proteins that change cell behavior. The aberrant activation of
the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway has a bearing on many
diseases,
including
cancer
and
neurodegenerative
dis-
eases.132,133 Moreover, this pathway also interacts with other

equipped us with a potent tool to explore cell interaction and

and proteomics, offer detailed observations of gene expression
and protein synthesis in single cells, respectively. These technol-
ogies have broad applications in biological and medical research,
offering fresh insights and possibilities for deepening our under-
standing of cell interaction and communication.
Single-cell sequencing is an advanced biotechnology that
facilitates detailed decoding of gene expression and genetic
alteration for each cell in a tissue sample. For example, single-
cell DNA sequencing permits accurate DNA mapping for each
unique cell. Going beyond this, the more intricate single-cell
multi-omics sequencing, this is to say single-cell multimodal
omics analysis, facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of various
dimensions of omics data from an individual cell. Practically,
single-cell multi-omics analysis efﬁciently records different
features of the identical cell in multiple tissue samples,
encompassing DNA, RNA, epigenetic regulations, and protein
patterns. This powerful approach has found extensive applica-
tion
in
systematically

the

foundation for cell communication study. In recent years, multiple
research efforts have concentrated on intercellular signaling by
employing either the co-expression of all genes or particular cell

effective approach to understand cellular communication at the
single-cell level, and a multitude of research endeavors are
dedicated to formulating strategies to construct cellular commu-

The review comprehensively outlines the experimental and
computational CCC methods rooted in chemistry and biology to
decode the complexities of CCCs. It extensively examines how
biological functions rely on CCCs to regulate crucial physiological
process, including tissue homeostasis, cell development as well as
immune responses.5,24 Furthermore, this review sheds light on the
role of CCC mechanisms in regulating various diseases, which
have not only expanded our understanding of CCC but also paved
the way for innovative clinical treatments.

It is noteworthy that since CCC serve as the downstream of all
data analyses,
setting thresholds
for LRIs can impact
the
interpretation and explanatory power of CCC results. A lower
threshold may lead to the identiﬁcation of more interactions,
including those with lower expression levels or frequencies, aiding
in the discovery of potential novel LRPs. However, this may also
introduce noise, including false-positive results.5,9 Conversely, a
higher threshold may reduce false positives but could also result
in missing some true LRIs. Therefore, when setting the threshold
for LRIs, a balance needs to be struck based on the speciﬁc
research objectives and characteristics of the data used to achieve
the most accurate and interpretable CCC results.
Spatial transcriptome-based tools
Typically, cellular interactions are conﬁned to restricted areas,
which is not captured by scRNA-seq.5 In order to minimize
incorrect exclusion in CCC analysis, integrating the cell’s medium
spatial position is essential.724 Spatial transcriptome technology
enables transcriptome proﬁling from cells in different locations on
tissue sections, facilitating the analysis of gene expression
characteristics at diverse spatial positions within tissues. mRNA
serves as the functional copy of active genes, and their localization
within living tissues is often related to the regulation of cell and
tissue growth and development. Previously, the analysis of
multiple mRNAs simultaneously required the crushing of cells,
making it impossible to understand the localization of mRNA
within cells. Fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) can
reveal environmentally speciﬁc transcripts while preserving the

INTRODUCTION
The coordination of cellular activities, essential for multicellular
existence, is contingent upon cell–cell interactions (CCIs) among a
variety of cell types and tissues throughout an organism.1–3
Cell–cell communication (CCC) is an essential process that
profoundly inﬂuences an organism’s homeostasis, development,
and disease processes.4 Typically, CCC involves interactions with
secreted ligands and plasma membrane receptors, yet it also
includes secretases, extracellular matrix proteins, transporters, and
direct cell-to-cell contact mechanisms.5 Different cells employ

THE CLINICAL APPLICATION AND RESEARCH PROGRESS OF
CCC
As the body adapts to internal and external environmental
changes, various systems and organs of the body need to
coordinate to complete the adaptive response, including nervous,
humoral, and self-regulatory systems. At the micro-level, these
three regulatory mechanisms rely on the coordinated activities of
various functional cells in the body, necessitating a complex signal
communication process between different cells, namely cell signal
transduction. CCC is so crucial in the development of tissues,
organs, and immune responses that diseases can emerge when
cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular information
(Fig. 3). Therefore, studying the mechanisms and regulation of cell
communication holds great scientiﬁc signiﬁcance for under-
standing the nature of biology and disease, and has practical
application value for clinical trials.
Some pathways may be abnormally activated or inhibited in

Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell
communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and
physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of
signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is
critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical
milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the
importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a
series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we
summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical
force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological
functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological
processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our
understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting i...

This

is

to
the
functioning of living organisms, inﬂuencing cellular metabolism,
energy transformation, maintenance of physiological functions,
regulation of growth, development, immune responses, single-cell

immune responses, CCCs enable immune cells to recognize and
combat pathogens. In growth and development, CCCs regulate
cell proliferation and differentiation, facilitating the normal
development of organs and tissues. Diseases typically manifest
when cells fail to interact correctly or misinterpret molecular
information.5
CCCs reﬂect the fundamental level of physiological commu-
nication, triggering responses to internal or external environments
essential for survival. When cells communicate with each other,
extracellular signals typically induce intracellular signal transduc-
tion cascades, leading to cellular responses such as changes in the
cytoskeleton, metabolism, or gene expression.10 The regulation

cascades modulate the pathway’s activity over time.11 Signal

crucial for the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of signal transmission. Cells
achieve precise signal localization and transmission by restricting
the distribution of receptors, enzymes, and other signaling
molecules to speciﬁc regions within the cell. In many types of
cells, speciﬁc receptors are localized to particular microdomains of
the cell membrane, such as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are cell
membrane regions rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, capable
of aggregating speciﬁc signaling proteins, including GPCRs and
RTKs.178,179 This localization enhances the interaction between
signaling molecules, improving the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of

activity of signaling molecules within speciﬁc temporal and spatial
ranges. Certain signaling proteins are transported to the cell poles
during speciﬁc phases of cell division or concentrated in the
leading edge during cell migration, ensuring the correct execution
of cell functions. The transmission of signals within neurons
depends on the precise release and reception of neurotransmit-

Thus, collective or global information in CCC, such as competition

Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy   (2024) 9:196 


Gene-targeting medications available commercially can effectively
reach therapeutic objectives by suppressing its function.
There are many other types of enzyme-linked receptors, among
which the more important ones include receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) and guanylate cyclase (GC) receptors. RTKs refer to
receptors
whose
intracellular
part
of
the
membrane
itself
possesses tyrosine kinase activity. The extracellular signaling
molecules that can bind to these receptors and complete signal
transduction are mainly various growth factors, such as epidermal
growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, ﬁbroblast growth
factor, and insulin. When the extracellular part of the receptor
binds to a ligand, the activation of the tyrosine kinase in the
cytoplasmic part of the receptor molecule occurs, thereby
triggering various signaling proteins to transmit signals along
different pathways reviewed below.
The Ras-MAPK is an important signaling pathway mediated by
RTKs, mainly composed of three key kinases: Ras, Raf, and MAPK.
When cells are stimulated by growth factors such as EGF, PDGF,
the growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, PDGFR) are activated,
leading to the accumulation of GTP-bound Ras (Ras-GTP).
Downstream Raf kinase is then activated by Ras-GTP on the
cell membrane, phosphorylating and activating MAPKK (MEK),
which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK (ERK).131
MAPK is able to phosphorylate downstream substrates, which
are often transcription factors (such as Elk1, Fos, Jun) or other
proteins that change cell behavior. The aberrant activation of
the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway has a bearing on many
diseases,
including
cancer
and
neurodegenerative
dis-
eases.132,133 Moreover, this pathway also interacts with other
signaling pathways such as PI3K–Akt, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), etc., jointly
regulating processes su...

ment of robust intercellular communication in early hair follicle
development.508
In
addition,
intercellular
signaling
across
various cell types is essential for nervous system development,
and ligand engagement plays a pivotal role in these develop-
mental dynamics. Dysfunction of prefrontal cortex attributes to
cognitive deﬁcits and most neurodevelopmental disorders, so
the intrinsic development-dependent signals that regulate
neuron generation and circuit formation was unveiled, which
gives a blueprint for comprehending the development of the
human prefrontal cortex during the early and mid-gestational
periods.509
A recent study revealed that ﬁve speciﬁc ligands (TGFβ2,
NLGN1, TSLP, DKK1, and BMP4) have synergistic contributions on
the progression of astrocytes in both human cerebral organoids
and primary fetal tissues.510 Moreover, the synergistic impact of
these ligands predominantly targets the mTORC1 signaling path-
way, leading to the transcriptomics and morphological character-
istics of astrocyte development. Furthermore, reciprocal signaling
interactions between fetal germ cells (FGCs) and their gonadal
niche cells were observed, showing that the cell proliferation of
FGCs was promoted through BMP signaling pathway. Then, BMP
signaling pathway regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by
coordinating the chromatin accessibility of its ligand genes,

sustenance of neural circuits, evidenced by their promotion of
neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons and enhancement of

microglia are known to regulate the activity of neuron by
enhancing myelin metabolism.290 The ability of exosomes to
access the bloodstream and cerebrospinal ﬂuid renders these
vesicles potential means for remote communication and trans-

speciﬁc targets.300 As exosomes are capable of traversing the

a precise and minimally invasive approach (via peripheral blood

as miRNAs, consequently triggering inﬂammation, inhibiting
autophagy, and contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s

Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell
communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and
physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular
communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of
signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is
critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical
milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed ...
