K15 is not mentioned in any test code, product, or connectivity test, unlike K5, K10, or K20.\n- **K20**: The evidence (`TestAllPairsNodeConnectivityApprox`, `cls.K20 = nx.complete_graph(20)`, etc.) shows that K20 has been explicitly used in connectivity and product tests.\n\n---\n\n### REASONING:\n\n- All options except **K15** have **direct, clear evidence** of use in test cases for complete graphs.\n- **K15** is noticeably absent from all test and evidence snippets provided.\n\n---\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) K15**",
